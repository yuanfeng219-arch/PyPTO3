"""Dynamic valid_shape examples.

Demonstrates a DSL pattern where the valid length of a tile is a runtime
scalar (caller-provided) and used inside ``pl.load(..., valid_shapes=...)``
to bound the active region of the tile, then padded via
``pl.tile.fillpad``::

    tile = pl.load(..., valid_shapes=[rows, vlen])   # vlen is a runtime scalar
    padded = pl.tile.fillpad(tile, pad_value=PadValue.min)

JIT note
--------
The pre-JIT version of this example also showed the same pattern with
``vlen`` selected via ``if/else`` (and inside a per-block loop).  In the
@pl.jit world the specializer's alpha-renamer rewrites the rebinding of
``vlen`` in the else-branch to a distinct alias, which then fails
``ConvertToSSA`` ("used outside its defining scope").  The current
recommended workaround is to push the per-call/per-iteration choice of
``vlen`` to the *caller* and pass a single scalar parameter -- as shown
below.  Restoring the in-DSL ``if/else`` pattern requires a JIT
specializer fix (see the comments in ``examples/models/qwen3_jit/``).

Note: ``__main__`` runs ``compile_for_test`` only (no device execution).
Full end-to-end execution is exercised under
``tests/st/codegen/dsl/test_dyn_valid_shape_loop.py`` and
``tests/st/codegen/dsl/test_dynamic_valid_shape_if_else.py``.
