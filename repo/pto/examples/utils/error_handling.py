"""Demonstrates that the @pl.jit pipeline rejects an invalid kernel at compile time.

The body rebinds ``result`` to ``pl.add(x, 1.0)``, discarding the prior write
of ``pl.mul(x, 2.0)``. The JIT specializer alpha-renames the rebinding to keep
the parser happy, but downstream codegen still surfaces a structural error
because the renamed local never reaches the ``pl.store`` (out parameter).
