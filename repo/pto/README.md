# PyPTO

**English** | [Chinese](README.zh-CN.md)

## Overview

PyPTO (pronounced: pai p-t-o) is a high-performance programming framework for AI accelerators, designed to simplify the development of complex fused operators and entire model networks while maintaining high-performance computing capabilities. The framework adopts an innovative **PTO (Parallel Tensor/Tile Operation) programming paradigm**, with a **Tile-based programming model** as its core design philosophy. Through a multi-level intermediate representation (IR) system, it compiles AI model applications built via APIs from high-level Tensor graphs step by step into hardware instructions, ultimately generating executable code that runs efficiently on target platforms.

### Core Features

- **Tile-based Programming Model**: All computations are based on Tiles (hardware-aware data blocks), fully leveraging hardware parallel computing capabilities and memory hierarchy
- **Multi-level Computation Graph Transformation**: Transforms Tensor Graphs into Tile Graphs, Block Graphs, and Execution Graphs through compilation passes, with each step including a series of pass optimization workflows
- **Automated Code Generation**: Compilation results generate low-level PTO virtual instruction code through CodeGen, which is then compiled into executable code for target platforms
- **MPMD Execution Scheduling**: Executable code is loaded to the device side and scheduled to processor cores on the device using MPMD (Multiple Program Multiple Data) approach
- **Complete Toolchain Support**: Full compilation artifacts and runtime performance data can be visualized through IDE-integrated toolchains to identify performance bottlenecks; developers can also control compilation and scheduling behavior through the toolchain
- **Python-friendly API**: Provides intuitive Tensor-level abstractions that align with algorithm developers' thinking patterns, supporting dynamic shapes and symbolic programming
- **Layered Abstraction Design**: Exposes different abstraction levels to different developers - algorithm developers use the Tensor level, performance experts use the Tile level, and system developers use the Block level

### Target Users

- **Algorithm Developers**: Primarily use Tensor-level programming for rapid algorithm implementation and validation, focusing on algorithm logic
- **Performance Optimization Experts**: Can use Tile or Block levels for deep performance tuning to achieve optimal performance
- **System Developers**: Can integrate with third-party frameworks or develop toolchains at Tensor/Tile/Block and PTO virtual instruction set levels

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Python**: Version 3.10 or higher
- **CMake**: Version 3.15 or higher
- **C++ Compiler**: Supporting C++17 standard (GCC, Clang, or MSVC)
- **nanobind**: Version 2.0.0 or higher (automatically installed during build)
- **scikit-build-core**: Version 0.10.0 or higher (automatically installed during build)

### Installation

#### Install from Source

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/hw-native-sys/pypto.git
   cd pypto
   ```

2. **Install in development mode** (recommended for development):

   ```bash
   pip install -e .
   ```

   Or with development dependencies:

   ```bash
   # Install CPU-only torch first (avoids pulling ~2GB CUDA dependencies)
   pip install torch --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu
   pip install -e ".[dev]"
   ```

3. **Install in production mode**:

   ```bash
   pip install .
   ```

The build system uses scikit-build-core to automatically handle CMake configuration and C++ extension compilation.

#### Build Options

- **Build type**: The default build type is `RelWithDebInfo` (optimized with debug symbols). You can override this:

  ```bash
  CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release pip install .
  ```

- **Enable ccache** (optional, for faster rebuilds):

  ```bash
  # ccache will be automatically detected and used if available
  brew install ccache  # macOS
  sudo apt-get install ccache  # Ubuntu/Debian
  ```

### Running Examples

PyPTO includes examples organized by complexity:

#### 1. Hello World (simplest program)

```bash
python examples/hello_world.py
```

#### 2. Kernel Examples (element-wise, matmul, softmax, ...)

```bash
python examples/kernels/06_softmax.py
```

#### 3. Model Examples (FFN, paged attention, LLaMA, ...)

```bash
python examples/models/01_ffn.py
```

### Running Tests

To run unit tests:

```bash
# Install with development dependencies (CPU-only torch first)
pip install torch --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu
pip install -e ".[dev]"

# Run unit tests in parallel
python -m pytest tests/ut -n auto --maxprocesses 8 -v

# Run a specific unit test file
python -m pytest tests/ut/core/test_error.py -n auto --maxprocesses 8 -v
```

For system tests, see `tests/st/README.md`.
