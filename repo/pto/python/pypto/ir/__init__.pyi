"""Type stub for pypto.ir — re-exports all public names from pypto_core.ir plus IR-level APIs.

TensorView and TileView are re-exported as the canonical C++ types from pypto_core.ir so that
type checkers treat ir.TensorView / ir.TileView as the same type as pypto_core.ir.TensorView /
pypto_core.ir.TileView.  At runtime these names resolve to Python factory objects that also
accept integer arguments, but the public type signature is unchanged.
