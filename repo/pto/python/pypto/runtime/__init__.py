"""
PyPTO runtime module.

Provides utilities for compiling a ``@pl.program`` and running it on an
Ascend NPU (or simulator).

Example::

    import torch
    from pypto.runtime import run, RunConfig

    a = torch.full((128, 128), 2.0)
    b = torch.full((128, 128), 3.0)
    c = torch.zeros(128, 128)
    compiled = run(MyProgram, a, b, c, config=RunConfig(platform="a2a3sim"))
