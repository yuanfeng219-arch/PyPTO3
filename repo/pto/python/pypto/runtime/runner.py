@dataclass
class RunConfig:
    """Configuration for a :func:`run` invocation or harness test execution.

    Attributes:
        platform: Target execution platform — ``"a2a3sim"`` / ``"a2a3"``
            (Ascend 910B) or ``"a5sim"`` / ``"a5"`` (Ascend 950).
        device_id: Hardware device index (ignored for simulator).
        rtol: Relative tolerance for result comparison.
        atol: Absolute tolerance for result comparison.
        strategy: PyPTO optimisation strategy applied during compilation.
        backend_type: Code-generation backend (:attr:`BackendType.Ascend910B` by default).
        dump_passes: If ``True``, dump intermediate IR after each pass.
        save_kernels: If ``True``, retain generated artefacts after execution.
            When ``False`` (default), a temporary directory is used and cleaned up.
        save_kernels_dir: Directory to save generated artefacts when *save_kernels*
            is ``True``.  If ``None``, a timestamped directory is created under
            ``build_output/<program_name>_<timestamp>``.
        codegen_only: If ``True``, stop after code generation without executing
            on device.  Useful for validating compilation output.
        pto_isa_commit: If set, pin the pto-isa clone to this specific git
            commit (hash or tag).  ``None`` means use the latest remote HEAD.
        enable_l2_swimlane: Capture per-task L2 perf records into
            ``<work_dir>/dfx_outputs/l2_swimlane_records.json``. On onboard
            platforms, ``swimlane_converter`` then produces
            ``merged_swimlane_*.json`` alongside it. Because the converter joins
            the timing against a task graph that only ``deps.json`` carries,
            enabling this on an onboard platform runs the kernel **twice**: a
            first dep_gen pass to capture ``deps.json`` (run in a subprocess so
            its device/SVM state is fully reclaimed before the timing pass — a
            failed capture is logged, not fatal), then a clean in-process
            swimlane pass (dep_gen off, since dep_gen collection perturbs the
            timing). Simulator platforms (``*sim``) stay single-pass
            and only emit ``l2_swimlane_records.json`` — the merged swimlane file
            is intentionally skipped because the simulator does not yet ship the
            task metadata the converter needs. Mirrors runtime's
            ``--enable-l2-swimlane`` flag.
        enable_dump_args: Per-task argument dump **level** written into
            ``<work_dir>/dfx_outputs/args_dump/``. Inspect with
            ``python -m simpler_setup.tools.dump_viewer``. Mirrors
            ``--dump-args``:

            * ``0`` / ``False`` — off (no dump).
            * ``1`` / ``True`` — **partial**: only the tensors marked via the
              DSL marker ``pl.dump_tag(t)`` (or ``pl.submit(..., dumps=[...])``).
            * ``2`` — **full**: every task's tensor inputs and outputs.

            Full dump on a large workload can saturate the host-side dump
            collector (~42 MB/s drain rate) and get the AICPU killed by a STARS
            op-execute timeout — prefer partial (level ``1``) plus
            ``pl.dump_tag(t)`` to limit dump to specific tensors
            (simpler#844 selective tensor dump).
        enable_pmu: AICore PMU event type. ``0`` disables collection;
            ``>0`` enables and selects the event (``2`` = PIPE_UTILIZATION,
            ``4`` = MEMORY — see ``runtime/docs/dfx/pmu-profiling.md``).
            Output: ``<work_dir>/dfx_outputs/pmu.csv``. Mirrors
            ``--enable-pmu N``.
        enable_dep_gen: Capture PTO2 dependency edges into
            ``<work_dir>/dfx_outputs/deps.json``. Render to HTML on demand via
            ``python -m simpler_setup.tools.deps_viewer <deps.json> --format
            html`` (the CLI defaults to text output). Mirrors
            ``--enable-dep-gen``.
        enable_scope_stats: Capture per-scope heap / task_window / tensormap
            ring-fill peaks into
            ``<work_dir>/dfx_outputs/scope_stats/scope_stats.jsonl``. Render to
            HTML on demand via ``runtime/tools/scope_stats_plot.py``. Mirrors
            ``--enable-scope-stats``.
        compile_profiling: If ``True``, enable compile profiling that records
            per-stage wall-clock timings (parse, passes, codegen).
            Results are written to ``report/pipeline_profile.{txt,json}`` in
            the output directory.
        diagnostic_phase: Override the diagnostic phase gate for compilation.
            ``None`` uses the default (``PrePipeline``, or ``PYPTO_WARNING_LEVEL``
            env var). Setting to ``None`` silences warnings AND performance hints;
            finer-grained control uses ``disabled_diagnostics``.
        disabled_diagnostics: Set of diagnostic checks to disable during
            compilation (covers warnings and perf hints). ``None`` uses the
            default (``UnusedControlFlowResult`` disabled, perf hints enabled).
        golden_data_dir: Target directory for ``.pt`` data files.  When set,
            the generated ``golden.py`` always loads tensors from this path.
            If the directory already contains all required ``.pt`` files they
            are reused; otherwise the directory is created and data is generated
            there.  Use a path from a previous run
            (e.g. ``build_output/<name>_<ts>/data``) to reuse existing golden
            data, or specify a new path to persist data to a fixed location.
        block_dim: Optional per-invocation override of the logical SPMD
            block count. ``None`` (default) defers to the value baked
            into ``kernel_config.py``'s ``RUNTIME_CONFIG`` at compile
            time (which itself may be unset, in which case the simpler
            runtime default applies). Set this when running the same
            compiled artifact on devices with different usable core
            counts.
        aicpu_thread_num: Optional per-invocation override of the AICPU
            thread count. Same precedence rules as ``block_dim``.
        ring_task_window: Optional per-invocation override of the runtime
            ring's task-slot window (number of in-flight tasks). Forwarded to
            ``CallConfig.runtime_env.ring_task_window``. A scalar (broadcast to
            all scope-depth rings) or a list/tuple of exactly 4 ints sizing
            rings 0..3 independently; each entry must be a power of two ``>= 4`` (a
            ``0`` list-entry leaves that ring at its default). ``None`` (default)
            leaves the field unset so the runtime falls back to its
            ``PTO2_RING_TASK_WINDOW`` env var or compile-time default.
        ring_heap: Optional per-invocation override of the per-ring output-heap
            size in **bytes**. Forwarded to ``CallConfig.runtime_env.ring_heap``.
            A scalar or a list/tuple of 4 ints (per ring 0..3); each entry must
            be a power of two ``>= 1024`` (a ``0`` list-entry leaves that ring at its
            default). ``None`` defers to the runtime's ``PTO2_RING_HEAP`` env var
            or compile-time default.
        ring_dep_pool: Optional per-invocation override of the per-ring
            dependency-edge pool capacity. Forwarded to
            ``CallConfig.runtime_env.ring_dep_pool``. A scalar or a list/tuple
            of 4 ints (per ring 0..3); each entry must be in ``[4, INT32_MAX]`` (a
            ``0`` list-entry leaves that ring at its default). ``None`` defers
            to the runtime's
            ``PTO2_RING_DEP_POOL`` env var or compile-time default.
        distributed_config: Optional L3 distributed-execution config, consumed
            only on the ``@pl.jit`` path. When set, it is forwarded to
            ``ir.compile()`` (via :func:`~pypto.jit.decorator._run_config_compile_kwargs`)
            so a HOST-level ``@pl.jit.host`` kernel compiles to a
            :class:`~pypto.ir.distributed_compiled_program.DistributedCompiledProgram`
            and dispatches per-rank. ``None`` (default) compiles a regular
            single-chip :class:`~pypto.ir.compiled_program.CompiledProgram`. The
            ``@pl.program`` :func:`run` entry point does not read this field; it
            forwards no compile-side overrides, so distributed ``@pl.program``
            execution is driven by ``ir.compile(..., distributed_config=...)``
            directly rather than through ``RunConfig``.
        analyze_auto_scopes_for_deps: If ``True``, enable compiler-derived task
            dependency analysis for AUTO runtime scopes during compilation.
            Defaults to ``False`` so existing runs keep using TensorMap fallback
            unless this behavior is explicitly requested.
        memory_planner: Who plans on-chip buffer memory —
            :attr:`~pypto.pypto_core.passes.MemoryPlanner.PYPTO` (PyPTO runs
            ``MemoryReuse`` + ``AllocateMemoryAddr`` and bakes physical
            addresses) or ``PTOAS`` (those passes are skipped and ptoas
            ``PlanMemory`` owns reuse and addressing). ``None`` (default) defers
            to the active ``PassContext``, or to ``PYPTO`` when none is active.
            Forwarded to ``ir.compile()``, which rejects it when a
            ``PassContext`` is already active — set it on that context instead.

    The runtime swimlane converter joins per-task timing against a task graph

    longer records per-task fanout. Because dep_gen collection perturbs timing,
    the graph and the clean timing must come from separate runs (the converter's
    documented "capture the graph once, time many times" workflow). So when
    swimlane is requested on an onboard platform we run:

      * Graph pass — dep_gen only, producing ``deps.json``. Run in a **separate
        subprocess** (*capture_deps*): the runtime's per-run finalize does not
        reliably reclaim the SVM host-register mappings the DFX collectors
        allocate, so a second DFX run in the same process hits the registration
        cap (``halHostRegister`` rc 8). A child process fully reclaims that
        state on exit. Best-effort — a failed capture is logged, not fatal.
      * Timing pass — swimlane (plus any other timing DFX), dep_gen off,
        producing the clean ``l2_swimlane_records.json``. Runs in-process.

    Both passes write into the same ``output_prefix`` (the subprocess is pointed
    at the same ``dfx_outputs/``), so the converter finds ``deps.json`` and the
    records side by side.

    Simulator platforms (``*sim``) stay single-pass: swimlane conversion is
    skipped there anyway (the simulator does not ship the task metadata the
    converter needs), so a second run buys nothing.
