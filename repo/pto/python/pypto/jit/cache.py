"""Compilation cache support for @pl.jit functions.

The active cache used by JITFunction is an in-memory dict on each instance (L1).
This module also defines the cache-key construction utilities and an on-disk
L2 cache implementation (l2_lookup / l2_store) that can be wired in by callers
to persist compiled artifacts across process restarts.

Cache keys encode source hash, tensor shapes/dtypes, scalar values, and the
PyPTO version so that a version upgrade automatically invalidates stale entries.
Dynamic dimensions (marked via bind_dynamic) are stored as None in the key
so different concrete values for that dimension share the same cache entry.

        scalar_values: Concrete value per scalar parameter name.
        platform: Target platform string (e.g. "a2a3sim"). Included in the key
            because compiled artifacts are platform-specific; a cache entry
            compiled for one platform must not be reused for another.
        strategy: Optimization strategy applied during compilation (an
            ``OptimizationStrategy`` member, or ``None`` for the JIT default).
            Included in the key because the strategy changes the compiled
            artifact; without it, calling the same kernel with two strategies
            (an A/B comparison) would return the first-compiled artifact for
            both.
        distributed_config: Optional ``DistributedConfig`` forwarded to
            ``ir.compile()`` on the ``@pl.jit.host`` path. Included in the key

            ``DistributedCompiledProgram`` and drives per-rank dispatch; without
            it, calling the same host kernel with two different ``device_ids``
            would silently reuse the first-compiled artifact. ``None`` (the
            single-chip default) leaves the key unchanged for non-distributed
            callers.
        analyze_auto_scopes_for_deps: Compile-side switch for deriving explicit
            task dependencies from AUTO runtime scopes. Included in the key
            because it changes generated orchestration dependencies.
        memory_planner: Effective on-chip memory planner (``PYPTO`` or
            ``PTOAS``) as resolved from the ``RunConfig`` field and any active
            ``PassContext``. Included in the key because it decides whether
            physical addresses are baked into the artifact (``--pto-level``
            level3 vs level2); without it, compiling one kernel under both
            planners would hand the second call the first one's artifact.
        enable_pypto_l0c_double_buffer: Effective dbC=2 (L0C double-buffer) opt-in
            under the PyPTO planner, resolved from the active ``PassContext``.
            Included in the key because it changes the AutoTileMatmulL0 /
            MemoryReuse output; without it a kernel first compiled with it off
            would reuse that artifact when later called with it on (and vice versa).
