"""Distributed-DSL op sentinels — ``pld.<category>.<op>`` plus unified short form.

Mirrors :mod:`pypto.language.op` for the distributed namespace: the
3-segment surface (``pld.system.<op>`` / ``pld.tensor.<op>`` /
``pld.tile.<op>``) is exposed as real Python sub-modules, while the
2-segment short form (``pld.<op>``) is re-exported from
:mod:`.unified_ops` via name-based dispatch.

Sub-modules (one per op category):

* :mod:`.system_ops` — host queries and CommContext accessors
  (``world_size``, ``get_comm_ctx``, ``rank``, ``nranks``).
* :mod:`.tensor_ops` — HCCL window-buffer in a comm-domain scope allocation, view
  materialisation, and cross-rank tensor bulk communication
  (``alloc_window_buffer``, ``window``, ``get``, ``put``).
* :mod:`.tile_ops` — cross-rank tile ops (``remote_load``, ...).
