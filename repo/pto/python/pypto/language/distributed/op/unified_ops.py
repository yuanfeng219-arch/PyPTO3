"""Unified ``pld.<op>`` dispatch — short-form re-exports for the distributed DSL.

Unlike :mod:`pypto.language.op.unified_ops` (which does runtime type-dispatch
between ``pl.tensor`` / ``pl.tile``), every short op name in ``pld`` maps to
exactly one category, so the short form is a plain re-export from the
canonical 3-segment surface — preserving signatures and docstrings for IDE
help with zero call-chain indirection.
