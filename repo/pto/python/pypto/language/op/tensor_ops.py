    Args:
        shape: List of dimension sizes (int or Expr)
        dtype: Data type of tensor elements
        layout: Tensor layout (default: ND)
        init_value: If given, the runtime pre-fills the freshly allocated
            buffer with this scalar on the AICPU (before any kernel writes it).
            ``init_value=0`` zeroes the buffer and works for every dtype.
            Non-zero values work for integer and 32/64-bit float dtypes;
            non-zero fills of fp16/bf16 are rejected at codegen. The fill only
            applies to this runtime-allocated buffer and is cheaper than
            ``pl.full`` (which materializes a constant tensor via a kernel).
        manual_dep: Opt this tensor out of OverlapMap auto-dep tracking for
            its **entire lifetime**. When True, every task that reads or
            writes this tensor skips OverlapMap lookup and insert, so the
            runtime neither makes the task wait on prior writers nor
            registers it as a producer for later readers. Creator retention
            (the original ``tensor.create``'s owner_task_id) still applies.

            This is the **tensor-lifetime** granularity of opting out of
            auto-dep tracking. The other two granularities, both orthogonal
            to this one, are:

              * ``with pl.manual_scope():`` — scope-wide opt-out.
              * ``pl.no_dep(t)`` at a kernel-call arg position — single-task
                opt-out for one arg.

            All three opt-outs compose with the orthogonal **explicit edges**
            mechanism (``pl.submit(..., deps=[...])`` / ``pl.at(..., deps=)``):
            the final task fanin is *auto-tracked deps* ∪ *explicit deps*,
            so you can use ``manual_dep=True`` to silence auto-tracking on
            a scratch buffer while still pinning its ordering with a
            ``deps=[tid]`` on the consumer.

            Internally also used by ``InjectGMPipeBuffer`` to mark the
            ring-buffer slots it synthesises.

def no_dep(tensor: Tensor) -> Tensor:
    """Mark a kernel-call argument as no-dependency (caller-site override).

    This is a parser-recognized marker — at runtime it returns the wrapped
    tensor unchanged. The parser detects ``pl.no_dep(t)`` at kernel call
    arg positions and threads the per-arg ``ArgDirection.NoDep`` override
    into the IR Call's attrs. ``DeriveCallDirections`` then overwrites the
    auto-derived direction at that slot to NoDep.

    Effect at runtime: the simpler runtime skips both the OverlapMap
    dependency lookup *and* the producer insert for this argument. The
    marker is legal regardless of whether the callee declares the param
    as ``In`` (read) or ``Out`` / ``InOut`` (write): the caller is
    asserting out-of-band that there is no RaW / WaW / WaR conflict on
    the slot — for example, paged-attention writes whose target offset
    is data-dependent (so the compiler cannot prove disjointness) but
    are guaranteed disjoint by the runtime allocation protocol.

    Only valid as a direct argument to a kernel call::

        # Read-side override: shared_input is read-only at the callee, but
        # auto-dep would otherwise serialise sibling fan-out reads.
        result = self.my_kernel(pl.no_dep(shared_input), output)

        # Write-side override: the callee writes into k_cache via
        # ``pl.assemble`` at a data-dependent offset; the user knows the
        # offsets are disjoint across the parallel fan-out.
        self.rope_kv_cache(q_proj, pl.no_dep(k_cache), pl.no_dep(v_cache))

    Outside a kernel call argument list it is a no-op (returns ``tensor``
    unchanged); the parser only injects the override at recognized call
    sites.

    Args:
        tensor: The tensor to pass through. Must be a ``Tensor`` value.

    Returns:
        The tensor unchanged. The marker is consumed at parse time.

    return tensor


def dump_tag(tensor: Tensor) -> Tensor:
    """Mark a tensor for selective dump within the enclosing orchestration.

    Declarative per-tensor dump marker (simpler#844 selective tensor dump).
    Writing ``pl.dump_tag(q)`` as a standalone statement records ``q`` so that
    every *subsequent* kernel dispatch consuming that exact value gets ``q``
    merged into the dispatch's ``dump_vars`` — whether that dispatch lowers to
    a plain ``ir.Call`` (the typical ``@pl.jit`` / tensor-op path) or an
    ``ir.Submit``. The runtime then marks those ``Arg`` slots via
    ``Arg::dump(...)``.

    This is the declarative counterpart to the explicit ``dumps=[...]`` kwarg
    on ``pl.submit(...)`` / ``pl.at(...)`` — both feed the same ``dump_vars``
    set (mirroring how a scope's auto-inferred and explicit ``deps=`` edges
    both feed ``manual_dep_edges``). Use ``dumps=`` when you want to list the
    targets explicitly at a single task launch; use ``pl.dump_tag`` when one
    declaration should stick across every subsequent consumer.

    Use this to keep tensor dump viable on large workloads (e.g.
    paged-attention 64bat/8192ctx) where full dump (``enable_dump_args=2``)
    saturates the host-side dump collector (~42 MB/s drain rate) by dumping
    every binding, eventually triggering a STARS op-timeout kill on the AICPU
    side. Run partial dump (``enable_dump_args=1``) and tag only the tensors
    of interest, so the runtime filters out large bindings (1 GB kv-cache,
    output buffers, etc.) from the collector queue.

    Semantics:

    * Forward-sticky over the orch scope — one ``pl.dump_tag(q)`` statement
      affects all *subsequent* kernel calls in the same orch that consume the
      tagged value. Tracked by **Var identity**, never by name: reassigning
      ``q`` (e.g. ``q = self.foo(q)``) produces a new value that the prior
      tag does **not** cover — re-tag it if needed.
    * Only effective under partial dump (``RunConfig.enable_dump_args == 1``)
      — selective dump filters within the partial pipeline. A no-op when dump
      is off (``0``); under full dump (``2``) every binding is captured, so the
      tag has nothing to narrow.
    * Consumed at parse time — recorded into the consuming dispatch's
      ``dump_vars`` and emits no IR statement of its own.

    Valid as a standalone statement inside an Orchestration function or an
    Inline helper (``@pl.jit.inline`` / ``FunctionType.Inline``) that the
    orchestration inlines. The parser rejects ``pl.dump_tag`` written in any
    other function type (AIV / AIC / Mix kernel bodies) with a clear error::

        @pl.function(type=pl.FunctionType.Orchestration)
        def orch(self, q: pl.Tensor[...], k_cache: pl.Tensor[...], out: pl.Out[...]):
            pl.dump_tag(q)           # mark q for selective dump
            pl.dump_tag(out)         # mark out for selective dump
            s = self.qk_matmul(q, k_cache, scratch)  # q is dumped here
            out = self.pv_matmul(s, k_cache, out)    # out is dumped here

    For a single task launch, list the targets explicitly with the
    ``dumps=[...]`` kwarg: ``out, tid = pl.submit(self.qk_matmul, q, k_cache,
    scratch, dumps=[q])`` or ``with pl.at(..., dumps=[q]) as tid:``.

    Inside an Inline helper, the recorded ``dump_vars`` ride on the inline
    body's kernel calls; the ``InlineFunctions`` pass splices those calls into
    the caller and the mutator substitutes the caller's arg for each inline
    parameter, so tags on both inline parameters and inline body-local
    ``pl.create_tensor(...)`` results take effect at the inlined call sites.
    No tag migration is needed; multi-level inlining works at the pass's
    fixpoint.

    Limitations (MVP):

    A tag fires only when the tagged Var reaches a kernel dispatch as a
    **static, whole-tensor Arg**. Values that never reach such an Arg are
    silently not dumped:

    * Dynamic-offset reads — a value read only through a data-dependent
      offset (``q_flat[runtime_row : runtime_row + N, ...]``) lowers to a
      gather / dynamic-address load, not a whole-tensor Arg, so the tag does
      not attach. Stage it through a buffer read with static, compile-time
      tiled offsets and tag that buffer.
    * Orch-level ``pl.assemble`` buffers — ``y = pl.assemble(y, tile, off)``
      lowers to a pure name-alias and emits no kernel dispatch, so there is
      no Arg to mark. Use a static in-place slice store ``y[off_slice] =
      tile`` and tag ``y``, or dump the producer kernels' output Args.
    * Orch-tier scalar reads — a tensor consumed only by orchestration-level
      ``pl.read(...)`` (e.g. block tables read to compute offsets) never
      enters a device kernel as a Tensor Arg; the MVP runtime path covers
      per-task device Args only.
    * Distributed L3+ programs: only chip-level orchestration tasks honour
      the tag; HOST-tier Python SubWorker tensors are not covered by the
      runtime's selective dump path.

    Args:
        tensor: The tensor to mark. Must be a ``Tensor`` value bound in
            the enclosing orchestration's scope.

        The tensor unchanged. The marker is consumed at parse time.

    """Gather elements of ``input`` (tensor-level) — index / mask / compare form.

    The tensor layer exposes a single unified ``gather``. Based on the arguments
    you pass, it lowers to one of three tile-level ops:

    Index form (``dim`` + ``index``) → :func:`pl.tile.gather`::

        output[b, k] = input[b, index[b, k]]

        MVP: only rank-2 inputs with ``dim == -1`` (or ``rank - 1``).
        ``index`` must be an INT32 tensor whose shape matches ``input`` on every
        axis except ``dim``.

    Mask form (``mask_pattern=<int>``) → :func:`pl.tile.gather_mask`:
        Selects columns of each row by a fixed hardware mask pattern. Last-dim
        shrinks by 2 (P0101/P1010) or 4 (P0001..P1000), or stays the same for P1111.

    Compare form (``kvalue`` + ``cmp_mode`` + ``out_cols``) → :func:`pl.tile.gather_compare`:
        Scalar threshold compare (applied to every row). Returns ``(dst, cdst)`` —
        gathered indices ``[rows, out_cols] INT32`` and per-row match counts
        ``[rows, 1] count_dtype``.

    Args:
        input: Source tensor (FP16/FP32/INT16/INT32).
        dim: (index form) Axis to gather along; only ``-1`` / ``rank - 1`` accepted in MVP.
        index: (index form) Index tensor (INT32) with same rank as input.
        mask_pattern: (mask form, keyword-only) Mask pattern selector (1-7).
            1=P0101, 2=P1010, 3=P0001, 4=P0010, 5=P0100, 6=P1000, 7=P1111.
        output_dtype: (mask form, keyword-only) Optional output dtype with the same
            bit width as ``input.dtype`` (e.g. FP32 → UINT32 for sort32 index bits).
        kvalue: (compare form, keyword-only) Scalar threshold (dtype must match ``input``).
        cmp_mode: (compare form, keyword-only) ``"eq"``/``"ne"``/``"lt"``/``"le"``/
            ``"gt"``/``"ge"`` or int 0..5.
        out_cols: (compare form, keyword-only) Output column count per row.
        offset: (compare form, keyword-only) Starting index offset (default 0).
        count_dtype: (compare form, keyword-only) Per-row count dtype, INT32 or UINT32

    Gathers scattered rows of a 2D paged KV pool ``src`` selected by ``indices``,
    translated through a paged ``block_table``, directly into an L1 (``space=Mat``,
    default) or UB (``space=Vec``) tile — so a subsequent matmul reads from L1

        block_size: Number of tokens per page block.
        size: Number of elements gathered per row (<= src columns).
        max_indices: Static upper bound on gathered rows; sizes the on-chip tile.

        col_off: Column start offset within each src row (default 0).

    """Scatter elements of ``src`` into ``input`` (tensor-level) — index or mask form.

    The tensor layer exposes a single unified ``scatter``. Based on the arguments
    you pass, it lowers to one of two tile-level ops:

    Index form (``dim`` + ``index`` + ``src``) → :func:`pl.tile.scatter` — the
    column-wise inverse of :func:`gather`, so ``index`` has the same shape as
    ``src`` (just like gather's index matches its output)::

        output = input
        output[b, index[b, k]] = src[b, k]   # for all b, k

        MVP: rank-2 input with ``dim == -1``. ``src``/``index`` are ``[rows, K]``;
        ``input``/output are ``[rows, S]`` with ``K <= S``. ``index`` element
        width must match ``input``: 4-byte input → INT32, 2-byte → INT16,
        1-byte → INT16.

    Mask form (``mask_pattern=<int>`` + ``dst``) → :func:`pl.tile.scatter_mask`:
        Writes each row of ``input`` into the columns of ``dst`` selected by the
        hardware mask pattern. ``dst.cols`` equals ``input.cols * stride``
        (stride = 2 for P0101/P1010, 4 for P0001..P1000, 1 for P1111).
        Unlike the gather mask form (a real ``pto.tgather`` ISA op on A2/A3 and
        A5), mask-pattern scatter is not a distinct pto-isa instruction — PyPTO
        emits it as a ``pto.tscatter`` mask-form construct for A2/A3 / CPU-sim
        style lowering paths.

    Args:
        input: Base tensor (FP16/FP32/BF16/INT8/INT16/INT32, 2D).
        dim: (index form) Axis along which to scatter. MVP accepts -1.
        index: (index form) Per-element destination column indices, same shape
            as ``src`` (INT16/INT32).
        src: (index form) Source values tensor (same dtype as ``input``).
        mask_pattern: (mask form, keyword-only) Mask pattern selector (1-7).
            1=P0101, 2=P1010, 3=P0001, 4=P0010, 5=P0100, 6=P1000, 7=P1111.
