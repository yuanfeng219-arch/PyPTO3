# Distributed Operators (N6)

## Overview

The N6 distributed op family gives the Python DSL direct, typed access to the
hardware's cross-rank communication primitives. Every op operates against a
**window-bound** [`DistributedTensorType`](ir/02-types.md) — a tensor whose
storage is a slice of a symmetric, per-rank communication window allocated by
`pld.alloc_window_buffer`. Verifiers in this family generally reject plain
`TensorType` (strict kind-trait matching — `As<DistributedTensorType>` does
not match a plain `TensorType`), so a non-window-bound tensor can never be fed
into a cross-rank slot by accident. **Two documented exceptions:**
`pld.tensor.put` (and its lowered `pld.tile.put`) accepts a plain `Tensor` on
the `src` side via `AsTensorTypeLike` — TPUT only needs a readable local GM
region for the source, so kernels can push directly from host-backed inputs
without first staging through a window buffer; `dst` still requires a
window-bound `DistributedTensor`.
`pld.tensor.get` (and its lowered `pld.tile.get`) accepts a plain `Tensor` on
the `dst` side via `AsTensorTypeLike` — TGET only needs a writable local GM
region to receive into, so kernels can TGET directly into host-backed output
tensors; `src` still requires a window-bound `DistributedTensor`.

There are **twelve ops** and **four ABI enums**:

| Op | Direction | Result | Hardware |
| -- | --------- | ------ | -------- |
| `pld.tile.remote_load` | pull (read peer → local tile) | `TileType` | TLOAD |
| `pld.tile.remote_store` | push (write local tile → peer) | `Unknown` (side effect) | TSTORE |
| `pld.tensor.get` | pull (read peer → local GM) | `Unknown` (side effect) | TGET |
| `pld.tensor.put` | push (write local → peer) | `Unknown` (side effect) | TPUT |
| `pld.tensor.allreduce` | collective reduce over window slices | `DistributedTensorType` (same as src) | builtin collective |
| `pld.tensor.barrier` | synchronise visibility of window data across ranks | `DistributedTensorType` (same as src) | builtin collective |
| `pld.tensor.broadcast` | replicate root rank's data to all ranks | `DistributedTensorType` (same as src) | builtin collective |
| `pld.tensor.reduce_scatter` | reduce and scatter chunks across ranks | `DistributedTensorType` (same as src) | builtin collective |
| `pld.tensor.allgather` | gather data from all ranks via window | `DistributedTensorType` (same as src) | builtin collective |
| `pld.tensor.all_to_all` | push-based symmetric personalized exchange — every rank pushes its per-destination chunks to every peer's window via `pld.tensor.put` (TPUT), returns window as result | `DistributedTensorType` (same as src) | composite |
| `pld.system.notify` | signal a peer's slot | `Unknown` (side effect) | TNOTIFY |
| `pld.system.wait` | block on own slot | `Unknown` (side effect) | TWAIT |

The five side-effect-only ops produce [`UnknownType`](ir/02-types.md): they
exist for their cross-rank effect, not for an SSA value a consumer reads.

## Namespacing: why `tile.*` vs `tensor.*` vs `system.*`

The namespace encodes the IR level the op lives at, not an arbitrary grouping:

- **`pld.tile.remote_load`** produces a *tile* (on-core SRAM region), so it is a
  sibling of `tile.load` and lives in `pld.tile`.
- **`pld.tile.remote_store`** consumes a *tile* (the symmetric write companion
  of `remote_load`), so it is a sibling of `tile.store` and lives in
  `pld.tile`.
- **`pld.tensor.get`** reads and writes *tensor* (GM) operands — `dst` may be a
  window-bound `DistributedTensor` or a plain `Tensor` (TGET only needs a
  writable local GM region to receive into) while `src` must be a window-bound
  `DistributedTensor` (the peer needs a window slot to read from). The VEC
  staging tile that TGET bounces through is materialised by
  `ConvertTensorToTileOps` as an internal `pld.tile.get`, never on the DSL
  surface. It is therefore a sibling of `pld.tensor.alloc_window_buffer` /
  `pld.tensor.window`, **not** of the tile-producing `remote_load`.
- **`pld.tensor.put`** reads and writes *tensor* (GM) operands — `dst` is a
  window-bound `DistributedTensor` (the peer needs a window slot to receive
  into) while `src` accepts either a window-bound `DistributedTensor` or a
  plain `Tensor` (TPUT only needs a readable local GM region on the source
  side). The VEC staging tile that TPUT bounces through is materialised by
  `ConvertTensorToTileOps` as an internal `pld.tile.put`, never on the DSL
  surface. It is therefore a sibling of `pld.tensor.alloc_window_buffer` /
  `pld.tensor.window`, **not** of the tile-producing `remote_load`.
- **`pld.system.notify` / `pld.system.wait`** drive the per-rank signal slot —
  pure control-plane synchronisation with no data operand — so they live in
  `pld.system`.

## ABI enums (`include/pypto/ir/comm.h`)

The four enums are an **append-only ABI**. Their underlying `int` values are
serialised as the op's kwarg payload (`op` for notify, `cmp` for wait, `atomic`
for put) and cast back to the enum at codegen time. New variants may only be
added **at the end** so existing IR and cached programs keep their meaning.

```cpp
enum class NotifyOp : int { kAtomicAdd = 0, kSet = 1 };   // pld.system.notify
enum class WaitCmp  : int { kEq = 0,        kGe = 1 };     // pld.system.wait
enum class AtomicType : int { kNone = 0,    kAdd = 1 };    // pld.tensor.put
enum class ReduceOp : int { kSum = 0, kMax = 1, kMin = 2, kProd = 3 };  // pld.tensor.allreduce
```

| Enum | Variant | Meaning |
| ---- | ------- | ------- |
| `NotifyOp` | `kAtomicAdd` | atomically add `value` into the peer's signal slot |
| `NotifyOp` | `kSet` | non-atomic store of `value` into the peer's signal slot |
| `WaitCmp` | `kEq` | block until `*signal_slot == expected` |
| `WaitCmp` | `kGe` | block until `*signal_slot >= expected` |
| `AtomicType` | `kNone` | plain remote store — overwrite the peer's dst slice |
| `AtomicType` | `kAdd` | atomically add the source data into the peer's dst slice |
| `ReduceOp` | `kSum` | sum-reduce every participating rank's window slice |
| `ReduceOp` | `kMax` | reserved max-reduce variant; lowering pending |
| `ReduceOp` | `kMin` | reserved min-reduce variant; lowering pending |
| `ReduceOp` | `kProd` | reserved product-reduce variant; lowering pending |

Each enum is mirrored across three layers (C++ `enum class` → `nb::enum_` in the
bindings → `.pyi` stub) and surfaced to the DSL as `pld.NotifyOp` /
`pld.WaitCmp` / `pld.AtomicType` / `pld.ReduceOp`. The deducer validates the packed `int`
against the enum range so codegen can cast back without a second guard.

## Op reference

### `pld.tile.remote_load` (TLOAD)

```text
pld.tile.remote_load(target, peer, offsets, shape) -> TileType(shape, target.dtype)
```

Reads a region of the `peer` rank's slice of a window-bound `DistributedTensor`
into a local tile. Mirrors `tile.load` at the IR level (positional `offsets` /
`shape` tuples, `TileType` result) but the source is a *remote* slice — the
address translation is realised at codegen by
`CommRemoteOffset(ctx, peer) + addptr + make_tensor_view`.

Verifier: `target` must be `DistributedTensorType`; `peer` must be a
`ScalarType` rank index; `offsets` / `shape` must each be a `MakeTuple` whose
rank equals `target.shape.size()`.

DSL (`python/pypto/language/distributed/op/tile_ops.py`) exposes `peer` /
`offsets` / `shape` as keyword-only for readability; the IR op keeps them
positional, matching `tile.load`.

### `pld.tile.remote_store` (TSTORE)

```text
pld.tile.remote_store(src_tile, target, peer, offsets) -> Unknown
```

Writes a local tile into a region of the `peer` rank's slice of a window-bound
`DistributedTensor`. Mirrors `tile.store` at the IR level (positional `offsets`
tuple + side-effect-only return) but the destination is a *remote* slice —
address translation happens at codegen via `CommRemoteOffset(ctx, peer) +
addptr + make_tensor_view`.

Verifier: `src_tile` must be `TileType`; `target` must be
`DistributedTensorType`; `peer` must be a `ScalarType` rank index; `offsets`
must be a `MakeTuple` whose rank equals `target.shape.size()`; `src_tile.dtype`
must match `target.dtype`.

Codegen: the tile is 2-D (height × width) after the standard tile pipeline; the
emitted `pto.partition_view` has the same rank as `target`, with the leading
`(target.rank - 2)` dims set to size 1 (matching `notify`'s `one_dims(rank,
"1")` pattern). This lets a 2-D tile push land on the inner two dims of any
N-D peer slice (N ≥ 2) without forcing the caller to reshape — and it is the
regression guard against the older codegen that emitted a fixed-2D
`partition_view` regardless of target rank.

DSL (`python/pypto/language/distributed/op/tile_ops.py`) exposes `target` /
`peer` / `offsets` as keyword-only for readability; the IR op keeps them
positional, matching `tile.store`.

### `pld.tensor.put` (TPUT)

```text
pld.tensor.put(dst, peer, src, *, atomic: int,
               chunk_rows: int = 0, chunk_cols: int = 0, pipeline: bool = False) -> Unknown
pld.tensor.put(dst, peer, src, dst_offsets, src_offsets, shape,
               *, atomic: int, chunk_rows: int = 0, chunk_cols: int = 0, pipeline: bool = False) -> Unknown
```

Synchronously writes local `src` data into the `peer` rank's slice of the
window-bound `dst`. `dst` is a GM-level `DistributedTensor` view; `src` may be
either a `DistributedTensor` view *or* a plain `Tensor` — TPUT only requires a
readable local GM region on the source side, so kernels can push directly from
host-backed inputs without first staging through a window buffer. The VEC
staging tile is materialised by `ConvertTensorToTileOps` as an internal
`tile.create + pld.tile.put`, so it flows through PyPTO's memory allocator and
never appears on the DSL surface.

With no offsets/shape this writes the full local `src` slice to the full peer
`dst` slice. Supplying `dst_offsets`, `src_offsets`, and `shape` narrows the
transfer to matching subregions; all three must be provided together.

**Staging-tile chunking.** By default the staging tile spans the whole
flattened transfer `[rows, cols]` extent (`rows` = product of the leading dims,
`cols` = the innermost dim), so a transfer must fit in UB. The optional
`chunk_rows` / `chunk_cols` attrs (`0` = full) shrink the staging tile to a
sub-tile of that extent; the codegen keeps the `pto.comm.tput` partition views
at the **full** transfer extent and pto-isa TPUT 2-D-slides the transfer through
the smaller stage. This lets a single `put` move data larger than UB without the
caller writing an explicit chunk loop. Oversized chunk values are clamped to the
transfer extent.

**Double-buffering (`pipeline`).** Setting `pipeline=True`
makes `ConvertTensorToTileOps` materialise **two** identical VEC staging tiles
(`tput_stage_ping` / `tput_stage_pong`) and thread both into `pld.tile.put` as a
second `stage` operand. The codegen then emits the ping-pong form
`pto.comm.tput(dst_pv, src_pv, buf(%ping, %pong) : …)`, which PTOAS routes to
pto-isa's double-buffered `TPUT` overload — it overlaps the TLOAD of the next
chunk with the TSTORE of the previous one across the two tiles. Because the
benefit only exists when the transfer is chunked into more than one piece,
`pipeline` **requires both `chunk_rows` and `chunk_cols` to be set** (the deducer
and the DSL both reject `pipeline` without a full chunk). The two tiles are
distinct `tile.create` allocations, so the memory allocator gives them
non-overlapping UB addresses (pto-isa's ping/pong requirement).

**Dynamic transfer extent.** The transfer may be **dynamic** — either the
subregion `shape` (a runtime sub-extent of the window) or the `dst` / `src`
window (`DistributedTensorType`) dims themselves, for a full-slice transfer.
pto-isa reads the extent from the partition views at runtime, so the codegen
emits a dynamic partition view (`<?x…>`) and chunks it. A dynamic flattened
transfer dim must be bounded by the corresponding static chunk, because the VEC
staging tile is statically allocated: a dynamic innermost dim requires
`chunk_cols`, a dynamic leading dim requires `chunk_rows`. For a full-slice
transfer the `dst` and `src` dims must match — by value when static, structurally
when dynamic.

Verifier: `dst` must be `DistributedTensorType`; `src` must be either
`TensorType` or `DistributedTensorType` (matched via `AsTensorTypeLike`);
`peer` must be a `ScalarType`; `dst` and `src` must share element type, rank,
and **positive** dimensions (positivity checked on static dims; dynamic dims are
allowed and bounded by the chunk). Full-slice `put` requires matching `dst` /
`src` shape; subregion `put` allows different full slice extents as long as the
explicit transfer region is in bounds (checked on static dims). Any dynamic
transfer dim requires a matching static chunk (see above). `atomic` selects
overwrite vs atomic-add (see `AtomicType`). The lowered `pld.tile.put` verifier
requires the staging tile to **fit within** the flattened transfer in both
**static** dims (it may be smaller — a chunk — but never larger; dynamic dims
are bounded by the chunk at runtime).

### `pld.tensor.get` (TGET)

```text
pld.tensor.get(dst, peer, src, *, chunk_rows: int = 0, chunk_cols: int = 0, pipeline: bool = False) -> Unknown
pld.tensor.get(dst, peer, src, dst_offsets, src_offsets, shape,
               *, chunk_rows: int = 0, chunk_cols: int = 0, pipeline: bool = False) -> Unknown
```

Synchronously reads the `peer` rank's slice of the window-bound `src` into the
local `dst`. `dst` may be a window-bound `DistributedTensor` or a plain
`Tensor`; `src` must be a window-bound `DistributedTensor`. The VEC staging
tile is materialised by `ConvertTensorToTileOps` as an internal
`tile.create + pld.tile.get`, so it flows through PyPTO's memory allocator and
never appears on the DSL surface.

With no offsets/shape this reads the full peer `src` slice into the full local
`dst` slice. Supplying `dst_offsets`, `src_offsets`, and `shape` narrows the
transfer to matching subregions; all three must be provided together. The
optional `chunk_rows` / `chunk_cols` attrs (`0` = full) shrink the staging tile
to a sub-tile of the flattened transfer extent so pto-isa TGET auto-chunks the
full transfer through it — same contract as `put` above, including a **dynamic
transfer** (the subregion `shape` or the full-slice `dst` / `src` window dims)
bounded by a matching static chunk (dynamic innermost needs `chunk_cols`,
dynamic leading needs `chunk_rows`). Setting `pipeline=True`
double-buffers the chunked read through two staging tiles
(`tget_stage_ping` / `tget_stage_pong`), emitting
`pto.comm.tget(…, buf(%ping, %pong) : …)` for pto-isa's ping-pong `TGET`
overload — same contract as `put`, and likewise **requires both `chunk_rows` and
`chunk_cols`**.

Verifier: `dst` must be either `TensorType` or `DistributedTensorType` (matched
via `AsTensorTypeLike`); `src` must be `DistributedTensorType`; `peer` must be a
`ScalarType`; `dst` and `src` must share element type, rank, and **positive**
dimensions (positivity checked on static dims; dynamic dims allowed, bounded by
the chunk). Full-slice `get` requires matching `dst` / `src` shape; subregion
`get` allows different full slice extents as long as the explicit transfer
region is in bounds (checked on static dims); any dynamic transfer dim requires
a matching static chunk. Besides `chunk_rows` / `chunk_cols`, `get` accepts no
keyword attributes.

### `pld.tensor.allreduce`

```text
pld.tensor.allreduce(src, *, op: ReduceOp = ReduceOp.Sum, mode: str = "mesh") -> DistributedTensorType(src)
pld.tensor.allreduce(src, signal, *, op: ReduceOp = ReduceOp.Sum, mode: str = "mesh") -> DistributedTensorType(src)
```

Reduces every participating rank's window-bound `src` slice in place and returns
the same type as `src`. The `mode` keyword selects the lowering algorithm:

- **`"mesh"` (default)** — direct all-to-all exchange with O(P) HCCL windows.
  Signal shape `[NR, 1]` (one cell per rank).  4-phase decomposition: notify-all
  (Set 1) / wait-all (Ge 1) / remote_load+accumulate / store-back with a
  post-reduce WAR-guard barrier (AtomicAdd 1 → Ge 2).
- **`"ring"`** — NCCL-style chunked reduce-scatter + allgather schedule with
  O(1) HCCL windows.  Signal shape `[2 * (NR − 1), NR]` (one row per ring
  round, one cell per rank).  2(P−1) ring steps with per-round barriers
  (AtomicAdd 1 → Ge 1).  Chunk size = `SIZE // NR`, and `SIZE` must be an exact
  multiple of `NR`; `LowerCompositeOps` constant-folds the chunk size when both
  `SIZE` and `NR` are compile-time constants.

Host-orchestrator user code may omit `signal` outside `for` and `while` loops;
the [`SynthesizeAllReduceSignals`](passes/37-synthesize_allreduce_signals.md)
pass inserts a private INT32 signal window with semantic shape `[world_size, 1]`
for that call (mesh mode only — `mode="ring"` requires an explicit signal). The
pass binds `world_size = pld.world_size()` as a standalone statement and uses
that variable in the synthesized buffer size and window shape. All calls in
loops are rejected because the current signal protocol is single-use. Explicit
`signal` remains the internal form used by InCore lowering and by tests that
intentionally construct the internal protocol. Comm-domain materialisation then
keeps the signal buffer in the same domain as `src`, even when it is not passed
to a user chip kernel. The public op currently accepts `ReduceOp.Sum` and
rejects the reserved reduce variants (`Max`, `Min`, `Prod`) until their
lowerings land. The host builtin lowering path currently supports the `Sum` +
FP32 variant and accepts either a rank-1 `[world_size]` signal or the
synthesized rank-2 `[world_size, 1]` signal.

### `pld.system.notify` (TNOTIFY)

```text
pld.system.notify(target, peer, offsets, value, *, op: int) -> Unknown
```

Writes `value` into the `peer` rank's signal slot of `target` (a window-bound
`DistributedTensor`, typically a 1-D INT32 "signal matrix"). `op` selects
atomic-add vs set (see `NotifyOp`).

Verifier: `target` must be `DistributedTensorType`; `peer` and `value` must be
`ScalarType`; `offsets` must be a `MakeTuple` of rank equal to the target rank.

### `pld.system.wait` (TWAIT)

```text
pld.system.wait(signal, offsets, expected, *, cmp: int) -> Unknown
```

Blocks until this rank's own signal slot of `signal` satisfies the `cmp`
predicate against `expected` (see `WaitCmp`).

Verifier: `signal` must be `DistributedTensorType`; `expected` must be
`ScalarType`; `offsets` must be a `MakeTuple` of rank equal to the signal rank.

## Shared codegen infrastructure

All five ops lower through PTO codegen helpers in
`src/backend/common/pto_ops_common.cpp` and `src/codegen/pto/pto_codegen.cpp`.
The reusable pieces — shared so each op's lowering carries no bespoke peer
arithmetic — are:

| Helper | Role |
| ------ | ---- |
| `CommRemoteOffset_<dtype>` | per-dtype MLIR helper (emitted once by `PTOCodegen::EmitCommRemoteOffsetHelpers`) that turns `(ctx, peer)` into the byte offset of the peer's window slice |
| `EmitCommRemoteView` | emits `CommRemoteOffset + addptr + make_tensor_view` at the call site, yielding the peer-addressed view (used by `remote_load`, `get`'s `src`, and `put`'s `dst`) |
| `EmitPartitionViewPTO` | wraps a tensor view in a full-slice `partition_view` with given offsets/sizes (used by every op for both local and peer operands) |
| `ResolveDistTensorBinding` | resolves a `DistributedTensor` arg to its codegen binding (type + window var) |
| `AsTensorTypeLike` | kind-trait downcast accepting both `TensorType` and `DistributedTensorType` where a view's element/shape info is read uniformly |

The local-vs-remote split is intentional: a *local* operand (e.g. `get`'s
`dst`, `put`'s `src`, `wait`'s `signal`) reuses the tensor view already created by
`EmitMakeTensorViews` with no peer arithmetic, while a *remote* operand (e.g.
`remote_load`'s `target`, `get`'s `src`, `put`'s `dst`) goes through
`EmitCommRemoteView`.

## Pipeline integration

Comm domains and their slot allocations are materialised by the
[`MaterializeCommDomainScopes`](passes/38-materialize_comm_domain_scopes.md) pass, which wraps each
host_orch body in nested `CommDomainScopeStmt` nodes (one per inferred comm domain) and produces the
per-window `WindowBuffer` records that the runtime binds physical buffers to.
Host-level tensor collectives are then lowered by
[`LowerHostTensorCollectives`](passes/39-lower_host_tensor_collectives.md) into internal builtin chip
dispatches before the final `Simplify`.

## Testing

- **IR / parser**: `tests/ut/ir/parser/test_remote_load.py`,
  `tests/ut/ir/parser/test_remote_store.py`, `test_system_ops.py`,
  `test_get_op.py`, `test_put_op.py`, plus the negative verifier coverage
  in `tests/ut/ir/test_distributed_ops.py`.
- **Codegen**: `tests/ut/codegen/distributed/test_distributed_pto_codegen.py`.
- **End-to-end (ST)**: `tests/st/distributed/test_l3_allreduce.py` (mesh
  allreduce with dynamic rank dim `NR = pl.dynamic("NR")`; **P=2** default,
  **P=4** on any four devices (e.g. `--device=0,1,2,3` or `--device=0-3`)),
  `test_l3_allgather.py`, `test_l3_reduce_scatter.py`, `test_l3_broadcast.py`
  (each likewise dynamic-NR, P=2/P=4),
  `test_l3_tensor_allreduce_intrinsic.py`, `test_l3_tensor_allreduce_ring_intrinsic.py`,
  `test_l3_allreduce_ring.py` (hand-rolled ring RS+AG), `test_l3_host_tensor_allreduce.py`,
  `test_l3_ep_dispatch_combine.py`, `test_l3_notify_wait.py`, and related L3 STs
  under `tests/st/distributed/`. **Put/get canonical e2e contracts** are now
  enabled: `test_l3_put.py` (ring overwrite, row-offset put, atomic-add put, and
  chunked/pipelined transfers ✅), `test_l3_get.py` (ring read, row-offset get ✅),
  and `test_l3_remote_store.py` (tile-level subview push ✅). All tests use the
  `pld.system.notify` / `pld.system.wait` handshake pattern established by
  notify/wait and collective STs.
