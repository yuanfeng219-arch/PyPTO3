# MemoryReuse Pass

Uses dependency analysis to identify memory reuse opportunities and removes redundant alloc operations.

## Overview

This pass analyzes variable lifetimes and dependencies to enable memory sharing. Variables with non-overlapping lifetimes in the same memory space can share MemRef objects, reducing memory footprint.

After applying MemRef sharing, the pass also **removes redundant `tile.alloc` statements** for MemRefs that are no longer referenced by any TileType variable.

**Key insights**:

- Variables that don't overlap in lifetime can reuse memory
- Only variables in the same memory space can share MemRef
- Lifetime is determined by def-use analysis
- After sharing, MemRefs that become unreferenced are cleaned up along with their alloc statements

**When to use**: Run after [`MaterializeSemanticAliases`](29-materialize_semantic_aliases.md) and before AllocateMemoryAddr. Reduces memory allocation overhead. This pass does the *opportunistic* lifetime coalescing only; the *semantics-required* must-alias retarget (loop-carry / in-place — this pass's former "Step 0") now runs in `MaterializeSemanticAliases`, so `MemoryReuse` can be skipped independently (e.g. `memory_planner=PTOAS`, where ptoas owns lifetime reuse).

## Algorithm

1. **Lifetime Analysis**: Walk the full IR tree (including nested control flow bodies) to compute variable lifetimes via def-use analysis. Variables defined outside a loop but used inside have their lifetime extended to the end of the loop (loop-aware extension)
2. **Interference Check**: Identify variables with overlapping lifetimes
3. **MemRef Sharing** (global first-fit-decreasing packing, `IdentifyReuseOpportunities`): Within each memory space, intervals are packed **largest-first**; every later interval joins the first existing buffer all of whose members it can share with (non-overlapping lifetime + hazard/no-alias safe — see `can_share`). A buffer's allocated size is fixed by its first (largest) member, so admitting a smaller member afterwards costs nothing — and a *later, larger* interval can now host an *earlier, smaller* one. (The previous definition-order greedy had a one-directional size gate `source.size >= target.size`, so two lifetime-disjoint tiles whose small one was defined first were never coalesced.) The representative each member is rebased onto is the buffer's largest member; its `tile.alloc` dominates the whole function because InitMemRef hoists every alloc to the function-body head, so a representative defined after some of its members is safe. Because the packer no longer runs in program order, every pairwise gate (hazard, no-alias) is checked in both directions.
4. **Loop-carry re-alignment** (`AlignLoopCarriesToInitMutator`): Sharing (step 3) only retypes `AssignStmt`-defined vars (producers/init); loop-carried `iter_arg`/`return_var` nodes are excluded from the lifetime/sharing maps and keep their original MemRef. This step walks `ForStmt`s **top-down** and retypes each loop's `iter_arg`/`return_var` to its (now-reused) `initValue` MemRef, seeding `var_remap_` before recursing so a nested loop observes the corrected outer `iter_arg` as its init. Without it, a reused **nested pipelined `matmul_acc`** accumulator splits across two Acc buffers and step 5 emits invalid `acc→acc tile.move` ops that ptoas rejects on Ascend 910B ([#1352](https://github.com/hw-native-sys/pypto/issues/1352))
5. **Accumulator if-phi coalescing** (`TopDownRetargeter::CoalesceAccumulatorIfPhis`): `LowerPipelineLoops` peels a stage-2 K-loop into `if`-phis whose live branch is an in-place `matmul_acc` (on the accumulator buffer) and whose dead `if k==0` branch is a fresh `matmul` seed on a *different* Acc buffer. Left alone, step 6 reconciles them with an `acc→acc tile.move` — a second co-live L0C buffer (overflow) that ptoas also rejects (no legal Acc→Acc `tmov`). This step identifies the in-place-accumulator branch by its `reuses_input` producer and retargets the *other* branch's seed onto the accumulator buffer, so both branches share it and no move is emitted (matching `mad_acc`'s shared-`%dst` semantics). Scoped to `Acc`; the retarget is **mandatory** (a declined retarget is an `INTERNAL_CHECK`, never a move — no legal Acc→Acc move exists). It bypasses the *global* dead-at-assign liveness check (which would false-decline on the legitimate post-if phi consumer), but only after verifying the two preconditions branch exclusivity actually needs: (a) the seed producer is a `Call` lexically **inside** the branch (a pre-if value yielded through the branch runs unconditionally and would clobber the accumulator the sibling in-place branch reads), and (b) a **branch-scoped** `IsTargetDeadAtAssign` (bounded to stop at the enclosing `if`) finds no same-branch tail read of the accumulator buffer. When either fails, the phi is left to step 6 instead of being coalesced
6. **Yield fixup**: Fix MemRef mismatches in control flow return variables:
   - **ForStmt**: Ensure all 4 loop-carry variables (initValue, iter_arg, yield value, return_var) share the same MemRef. Inserts `tile.move` before yield if MemRefs differ
   - **IfStmt**: Patch return_vars to match yield value's MemRef
7. **Identity-copy buffer normalization** (`NormalizeIdentityCopyBuffersMutator`): after step 5 retargets an accumulator if-phi, a downstream bare-`Var` SSA identity copy of the (now-moved) return_var can still carry the pre-coalesce buffer (e.g. `c: …mem_acc_17 = c_phi` after `c_phi` moved to `mem_acc_5`). An `x = y` copy (value a bare `Var`, not a `Call`) is a pure rename and must alias `y`'s buffer, so this single forward pass retypes such a copy's LHS to the RHS's MemRef and substitutes the LHS's downstream uses. No-op when no mismatch exists
8. **Remove redundant allocs**: Collect all MemRefs still referenced by TileType variables, then remove `tile.alloc` statements whose MemRef is no longer in use

**Reuse conditions**:

- Non-overlapping lifetimes (no interference). Two variables do NOT overlap when `prev.last_use <= curr.def` (i.e., the source's last use can be at the same statement as the target's definition, since inputs are read before outputs are written within a single statement).
- Same memory space
- A buffer is sized to its **largest** member; because packing is largest-first, every member admitted later is no larger than the representative, so no explicit byte-size check is needed (and the reuse direction is no longer constrained to "earlier-and-larger only")
- **No-alias guard** (op-semantic): the op that defines the reusing variable may forbid its output from sharing a buffer with one or more of its input operands, because the hardware reads those inputs *while* writing the output — an in-place write would corrupt the op mid-flight. Three sources feed one per-output forbidden-input set (`ForbidAliasCollector`):
  - `not_inplace_safe()` — the op cannot run with `src == dst`, so its output must not alias **any** input operand.
  - `forbid_output_alias(i)` — the op is in-place-safe w.r.t. its value operands but reads a **specific** operand while writing its output, so the output must not alias that one operand's buffer.
  - **widening `tile.cast`** (handled directly in `ForbidAliasCollector`) — when the output dtype is *wider* than the input, the cast cannot run in place: element `i` is read at `i*in_bytes` but written at `i*out_bytes`, so the write cursor outruns the read cursor and clobbers not-yet-converted input. Narrowing / same-width casts stay in-place-safe (preserving the cross-dtype reuse below).

  MemoryReuse refuses to place the output on a forbidden operand's **physical buffer**, resolving each operand through both reuse-map coalescing *and* VIEW inheritance (a `reshape`/`slice` shares its source's MemRef base) — so a forbidden operand reached indirectly (its owning tile reused onto another buffer, or occupied via a view) is still caught.

  Ops that currently declare a no-alias constraint:

  | Op(s) | Constraint | Why the output cannot alias the input |
  | ----- | ---------- | ------------------------------------- |
  | `tile.recip`, `tile.rsqrt` | `not_inplace_safe` | high-precision path reads the input **and** a tmp scratch while writing the output |
  | `tile.row_sum` / `row_max` / `row_min` | `not_inplace_safe` | `TROW*` reads the full input row + tmp scratch while writing the reduced `[M, 1]` output |
  | `tile.mrgsort_format1` | `not_inplace_safe` | merge-sort intrinsic requires `src != dst` |
  | `tile.fmod`, `tile.fmods` | `not_inplace_safe` | `TFMOD`/`TFMODS` compute `a - trunc(a/b)*b` by overwriting `dst = a/b` first, then re-reading the original `src0` (`a`) for the final subtraction; when `dst == src0` that subtraction sees the already-clobbered quotient and yields `0` for every element |
  | `tile.transpose` | `not_inplace_safe` | `pto.ttrans` is not in-place safe: the a2a3 unaligned scalar path writes `dst` directly from `src` (no tmp staging), so `dst == src` corrupts the data mid-write. The output always gets a fresh buffer (also enforced in InitMemRef, which never inherits the input's buffer for it). |
  | `tile.sel` | `forbid_output_alias(0)` (mask), `(3)` (tmp) | `TSEL` reads the predicate mask + tmp scratch while writing `dst` |
  | `tile.{row,col}_expand{,_mul,_add,_sub,_div}` | `forbid_output_alias(1)` (broadcast vector) | the row/col vector (arg 1) is re-read for **every** output row/col, so an output aliasing it is overwritten after the first row/col |
  | `tile.cast` (widening only) | output ≠ input buffer (conditional, in `ForbidAliasCollector`) | wider output's write cursor outruns the read cursor (see above) |

- **Pipeline-stage guard** (capacity-gated): `pl.pipeline(stage=F)` replicates a loop body `F` times for ping-pong, and `LowerPipelineLoops` tags each clone's tile-producing `Call` with a `pipeline_membership` `(group, stage)` (see [25-lower_pipeline_loops.md](25-lower_pipeline_loops.md)). The `F` clones run concurrently under the scheduler, so their program-order-disjoint lifetimes are *not* a safe reuse signal — collapsing concurrent clones onto one buffer injects a false write-after-read that serializes the stages (the #1475 cube-matmul-operand collapse). MemoryReuse therefore keeps concurrent clones in **distinct buffers in every memory space** — including the L0 matmul spaces (Left/Right/Acc/Bias), and regardless of whether a tile is a load or a `tile.move` result — up to the **max-affordable double-buffering depth** `F_g = min(depth_g, ⌊C_s / slot_g⌋)`: a clone at stage `k` lands in residue `ordinal(k) mod F_g` (the **dense** stage ordinal, so sparse stage IDs like `{0, 2}` can't collide via raw `2 mod 2 == 0 mod 2`), so concurrent clones never share (full ping-pong when it fits, maximal spread when the space is tight). Whether the separation fits is decided by the **exact per-space allocator footprint** (`SpaceFootprint`, shared with `AllocateMemoryAddr` — parity by construction), not an estimate. When a space still overflows at every group's affordable depth, a **graceful cross-group shed** lowers one group's depth by a residue and re-packs (choosing the group by the `MaxRelief` heuristic — free the most bytes first, ties by lowest group id); if the shed exhausts, the pass re-packs from scratch in a **legacy fallback** (`force_legacy`), so it never overflows where the legacy packing would have fit. A space whose capacity is unknown (no backend configured) uses the legacy predicate, so the capacity-gated path is never worse than legacy. When the gate reduces a group below its requested `stage=` depth (or a space hits the legacy fallback), MemoryReuse emits a diagnostic through the unified channel — a `PH-MR-001` **perf hint** (or a **warning** for the fallback) naming the requested vs achieved depth and the fix (shrink the per-stage tile to `≤ C_s / stage`, or lower `stage=` to what fits) — so a capacity-forced serialization is never silent. Once the reuse decision is made, MemoryReuse strips the now-consumed `pipeline_membership` attr so it does not ride downstream into later passes or codegen.

**No shape / dtype / TileView compatibility gate**: tiles that share a physical MemRef may carry **different** shapes, dtypes, or `TileView` attributes. PTO codegen binds a per-variable `alloc_tile` to each tile, so each alias declares the shared base with its own static shape / dtype / layout / `valid_shape`. This permits, for example:

- cross-dtype reuse — a BF16 tile reusing a dead FP32 tile's buffer (e.g. across `tile.cast`);
- `tile.fillpad` output reusing its input, and two fillpad outputs with different `pad` sharing one buffer;
- N-D tiles with divergent `valid_shape` sharing a buffer (each keeps its own `valid_shape` on its own `alloc_tile`);
- L0 cube-input `Left` / `Right` sub-tiles of differing shape sharing one slot (e.g. fused-attention QK `Right` `[k, SEQ]` reused by PV `Right` `[k', HEAD]`, halving peak L0B — issue #1595).

  Earlier revisions gated reuse on an `AreTileTypesCompatible` shape / dtype / view match (with a narrow L0 byte-reuse exception); that gate has been removed. Correctness for read-while-write ops is now handled precisely by the no-alias guard above rather than by a coarse whole-tile match.

**Alloc cleanup**:

After MemRef sharing, some MemRef objects become unreferenced (their variables now point to a different shared MemRef). The pass traverses the surrounding `SeqStmts` and removes any `tile.alloc` `AssignStmt` whose LHS MemRef pointer is not in the set of still-used MemRefs.

## Ascend910B load + tpop_from_aic hazard

On Ascend910B AIV functions with a non-`None` `SplitMode`, a writer that consumes **both** a `tile.load` result (or a legal-view descendant of one) **and** a `tile.tpop_from_aic` value must not place its output in the same physical buffer as that load result. Allowing the writer's output to in-place-reuse the load buffer produces silently wrong results on this hardware.

MemoryReuse owns every buffer-coalescing decision, so it prevents the hazardous sharing from ever forming rather than relying on a later split. When the guard is active, the reuse decision is blocked exactly when:

- the writer's defining op consumes a `tile.tpop_from_aic` value, **and**
- the buffer member it would reuse in place (whose last use is the writer's def statement) is load-derived.

The guard is gated by `BackendHandler::RequiresSplitLoadTpopWorkaround()` (true only for Ascend910B) and the function being split-AIV; on every other backend / function kind the inputs are empty and reuse behaviour is unchanged. The writer is still free to reuse any **non**-load buffer — only the load + tpop in-place combination is rejected. (This guard previously lived in a dedicated `LegalizePTOBufferReuse` pass that split the buffer after the fact; it now folds into MemoryReuse.)

## Example

### MemRef Sharing with Alloc Cleanup

**Before** (after InitMemRef):

```python
# SeqStmts [
mem_vec_0: MemRefType = tile.alloc(Vec, -1, 16384, 0)
mem_vec_1: MemRefType = tile.alloc(Vec, -1, 16384, 1)
mem_vec_2: MemRefType = tile.alloc(Vec, -1, 16384, 2)
tile_a: Tile[[64, 64], FP32, memref=mem_vec_0] = tile.load(...)
tile_b: Tile[[64, 64], FP32, memref=mem_vec_1] = tile.add(tile_a, ...)
# tile_a last use ↑
tile_c: Tile[[64, 64], FP32, memref=mem_vec_2] = tile.load(...)
# ]
```

**After** (tile_c reuses mem_vec_0 from tile_a, alloc for mem_vec_2 removed):

```python
# SeqStmts [
mem_vec_0: MemRefType = tile.alloc(Vec, -1, 16384, 0)
mem_vec_1: MemRefType = tile.alloc(Vec, -1, 16384, 1)
# mem_vec_2 alloc removed — no longer referenced
tile_a: Tile[[64, 64], FP32, memref=mem_vec_0] = tile.load(...)
tile_b: Tile[[64, 64], FP32, memref=mem_vec_1] = tile.add(tile_a, ...)
tile_c: Tile[[64, 64], FP32, memref=mem_vec_0] = tile.load(...)
# tile_c now shares mem_vec_0 with tile_a
# ]
```

### Producer-Consumer Reuse

When a variable's last use is at the same statement that defines a new variable (producer-consumer relationship), the new variable can reuse the old variable's memory because inputs are read before outputs are written:

```python
# Before:
tile_a: Tile[[64, 64], FP32, memref=mem_vec_0] = tile.create(...)
tile_b: Tile[[64, 64], FP32, memref=mem_vec_1] = tile.muls(tile_a, 0.0)
# tile_a.last_use == tile_b.def → reuse allowed

# After:
tile_a: Tile[[64, 64], FP32, memref=mem_vec_0] = tile.create(...)
tile_b: Tile[[64, 64], FP32, memref=mem_vec_0] = tile.muls(tile_a, 0.0)
# tile_b reuses mem_vec_0
```

### Overlapping Lifetimes (No Reuse)

When a variable is still alive **after** another variable's definition (last_use > def), their lifetimes truly overlap and they cannot share memory:

```python
# SeqStmts [
mem_vec_0: MemRefType = tile.alloc(Vec, -1, 16384, 0)
mem_vec_1: MemRefType = tile.alloc(Vec, -1, 16384, 1)
tile_a: Tile[[64, 64], FP32, memref=mem_vec_0] = tile.load(...)
tile_b: Tile[[64, 64], FP32, memref=mem_vec_1] = tile.load(...)
# tile_a.last_use > tile_b.def → tile_a still live when tile_b is defined
# ]
```

## Implementation

**Header**: `include/pypto/ir/transforms/passes.h`

```cpp
Pass MemoryReuse();
```

**Implementation**: `src/ir/transforms/memory_reuse_pass.cpp`

- `LifetimeAnalyzer` walks the full IR tree to compute variable lifetimes (including nested control flow)
- `ComputeLifetimes` builds MemRef sharing groups and lifetime intervals
- `IdentifyReuseOpportunities` finds reuse candidates
- `ApplyMemRefSharing` updates MemRef pointers via `MemRefSharingMutator`
- `TopDownRetargeter::CoalesceAccumulatorIfPhis` coalesces peeled loop-carried accumulator `if`-phis by retargeting the dead-branch seed onto the in-place accumulator buffer, so `YieldFixupMutator` never emits an illegal `acc→acc tile.move` (see Algorithm step 5)
- `YieldFixupMutator` fixes ForStmt/IfStmt yield/return_var MemRef mismatches after reuse (inserts `tile.move` when needed)
- `NormalizeIdentityCopyBuffersMutator` reconciles bare-`Var` SSA identity copies whose LHS/RHS buffers diverged after accumulator if-phi coalescing (see Algorithm step 7)
- `UsedMemRefCollector` gathers still-referenced MemRef pointers after sharing
- `RemoveUnusedAllocStatements` filters out redundant `tile.alloc` statements from `SeqStmts`

**Python binding**: `python/bindings/modules/passes.cpp`

```cpp
passes.def("memory_reuse", &pass::MemoryReuse, "Memory reuse optimization");
```

**Tests**: `tests/ut/ir/transforms/test_memory_reuse.py`

- Tests non-overlapping lifetime reuse with MemRef sharing
- Tests producer-consumer reuse (last_use == def at same statement)
- Tests overlapping lifetime no-reuse
- Tests memory space separation
- Tests byte-size compatibility
- Tests cross-dtype / cross-`TileView` reuse (now permitted: BF16↔FP32, fillpad output↔input, divergent `valid_shape`)
- Tests the no-alias guard (`TestForbidOutputAlias` + `TestInplaceOps`), one case per constraint above:
  - `tile.recip` / `tile.rsqrt` / `tile.row_sum` — output must not alias input (`not_inplace_safe`)
  - `tile.sel` — output must not alias the mask / tmp (`forbid_output_alias`)
  - `tile.col_expand_mul` — output must not alias the broadcast vector
  - widening `tile.cast` — output must not alias the (narrower) input
  - a forbidden operand reached through a VIEW is still honored (physical-buffer resolution)
- Tests view operation MemRef sharing preservation
- Tests redundant alloc statement removal
- Tests control flow lifetime analysis (nested IfStmt in ForStmt, branch variable sharing)
