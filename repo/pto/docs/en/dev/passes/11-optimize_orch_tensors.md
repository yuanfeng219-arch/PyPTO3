# OptimizeOrchTensors Pass

Optimizes tensor buffer usage across orchestration and InCore functions by eliminating redundant allocations and improving data flow.

## Overview

After `ConvertTensorToTileOps`, orchestration functions allocate output tensors (`tensor.create`) at every InCore call site, even inside loops where the same buffer could be reused. This pass applies five optimization patterns to reduce allocations, improve buffer layout information, and make statically provable local tensor windows explicit at orchestration call sites.

**Requirements**:

- Input IR must have InCore scopes outlined with tile ops (run `ConvertTensorToTileOps` first)

**When to use**: Run immediately after `ConvertTensorToTileOps` and before `FlattenTileNdTo2D`.

## API

| C++ | Python | Level |
| --- | ------ | ----- |
| `pass::OptimizeOrchTensors()` | `passes.optimize_orch_tensors()` | Program-level |

**Python usage**:

```python
from pypto.pypto_core import passes

opt_pass = passes.optimize_orch_tensors()
program_opt = opt_pass(program)
```

## Patterns

The pass applies five patterns in sequence. Each pattern sees the results of the previous one.

### Pattern 1: Iter-Arg Reuse (IterArgReuseOptimizer)

**Problem**: Inside a `for`/`while` loop, each iteration allocates a new output tensor via `tensor.create`, even though the InCore result feeds back as an iter-arg to the next iteration.

**Solution**: Merge the `Out` param into the corresponding `In` param (promoted to `InOut`), remove the `tensor.create`, and redirect `tile.store` to write into the reused buffer.

**Before**:

```python
for i in pl.range(N, init_values=[init_buf]):
    out: pl.Tensor = pl.tensor.create(shape, dtype=pl.FP32)  # redundant alloc
    result: pl.Tensor = self.incore_fn(iter_arg, out)          # In + Out params
    pl.yield_(result)
```

**After**:

```python
for i in pl.range(N, init_values=[init_buf]):
    result: pl.Tensor = self.incore_fn(iter_arg)  # InOut param (reuses iter-arg buffer)
    pl.yield_(result)
```

### Pattern 2: Assemble Parent Strides (AssembleParentStridesOptimizer)

**Problem**: When orchestration scatters InCore results into a larger tensor via `tensor.assemble`, the InCore function's `tile.store` doesn't know the parent tensor's strides, which can lead to suboptimal memory layout.

**Solution**: Analyze `tensor.assemble(parent, incore_result, offset)` patterns in orchestration. Attach the parent tensor's shape as `TensorView` strides on the InCore function's `Out` param type, so `tile.store` can use the correct memory layout.

### Pattern 3: Assemble-Loop Rewrite (AssembleLoopRewriter)

**Problem**: An InCore function contains a `for` loop that accumulates results via `tile.assemble` into an iter-arg, then stores the final result. The `tile.assemble` creates intermediate tile copies each iteration.

**Solution**: Rewrite the loop body to use `tile.store` directly (writing into the `Out` param), initializing the iter-arg from the `Out` param instead of a `tile.create`.

### Pattern 4: Slice Input Strides (SliceInputStridesOptimizer)

**Problem**: When orchestration passes a sliced tensor (`tensor.slice`) as an `In` argument to an InCore function, the InCore function's parameter has contiguous strides (computed from its own shape), not the parent tensor's strides. This causes incorrect memory access when the slice is a non-contiguous view of the parent.

**Solution**: Analyze `tensor.slice(parent, size, offset)` patterns in orchestration. When a slice result is passed as an `In` argument to an InCore call, attach the parent tensor's shape-derived strides via `TensorView` on the InCore function's `In` param type, so `tile.load` uses the correct memory layout.

### Pattern 5: Static Window Externalization (OutWindowExternalizer)

Pattern 5 runs **only** on InCore-type functions (`InCore`, `AIC`, or `AIV`) explicitly annotated with `windowize=True`. Unannotated kernels are never windowed regardless of access pattern.

**Problem**: An outlined callee may write only a statically provable local window of a large `Out` tensor, or consume only a statically provable local window of a large `In` tensor, but the call site still passes the whole tensor. Downstream dependence analysis then sees whole-buffer accesses and may add unnecessary serialization.

**Solution**: Clone the callee to a `__windowed` variant with narrowed rewritten tensor parameter types and localized internal offsets. Rewrite the orchestration call site to explicit local slices. Output windows use `slice + __windowed call + assemble`:

```python
out_window = pl.tensor.slice(out, shape, offset)
out_window_next = self.kernel__windowed(..., out_window)
out = pl.tensor.assemble(out, out_window_next, offset)
```

Input windows use the same call-site-local slice materialization, without an assemble:

```python
in_window = pl.tensor.slice(inp, shape, offset)
result = self.consumer__windowed(in_window, ...)
```

When a materialized slice would otherwise use a loop-return alias as its parent,
the pass rewrites that parent to the loop's visible init tensor for both
`ForStmt` and `WhileStmt`. This keeps generated orchestration C++ from
referencing loop-return SSA names outside their scope. Loop-carried iter-args
inside the loop body are not folded this way.

This pass intentionally keeps window eligibility conservative. It does not special-case operator names such as `topk`; a tensor is windowed only when the callee body proves the access pattern below.

Supported rewrite shapes:

- `FinalStore`: the callee returns the result of a final `tile.store(...)` into one local window
- `AggregateWindowLoop`: the callee carries one or more `Out` tensors through a loop and writes a statically provable aggregate window, such as the outlined `kv_proj` group shape
- `PureInputWindowConsumer`: an `In` tensor parameter in a data-returning callee is used only through the same local input window
- `AggregateInputWindowLoop`: together with an `AggregateWindowLoop` output rewrite, an `In` tensor parameter is read only through loop-local `tile.load`/`tensor.slice` windows whose offsets expand across that same internal loop into one statically provable parent-shaped region, such as q/k inputs of qk norm

Output-window eligibility:

- the write must be a statically provable local `tile.store` window or aggregate window loop
- window shape and offset must be statically known enough to materialize a `tensor.slice`
- offsets must be affine in the surrounding loop variables accepted by the pass
- multi-`Out` rewrites are per-output: each `Out` param is independently evaluated for window eligibility, and unproven outputs stay as full-tensor baseline arguments
- if multiple externalized `Out` params at the same callsite resolve to the same parent tensor, that callsite stays full-tensor; Pattern 5 does not chain multiple `tensor.assemble` updates into one parent state
- sequential-loop siblings are rewritten only when every rewritten `Out` can be proven disjoint across sibling iterations
- same-scope sibling writers to the same parent or aliased parent tensor may still be externalized when each individual writer satisfies the static output-window eligibility rules; however, if that parent also has a sibling full writer (`Out` or `InOut`) that cannot be externalized as an output window, other writers to the same parent stay full-tensor so the non-window writer does not hide partially initialized regions
- write/write and write/read ordering for the remaining windowed writers is delegated to runtime TensorMap overlap on the actually submitted window descriptors
- sibling-writer alias collection descends into nested `SeqStmts`, `ForStmt`, `WhileStmt`, and `IfStmt` bodies, so tensor aliases such as loop returns and tuple projections are resolved to the visible parent before call-site slicing
- later full-parent reads do not disable output windowing; correctness is delegated to runtime TensorMap overlap dependence once the call site exposes the actual window tensor

Input-window eligibility:

- the parameter must be an `In` tensor
- every reference to that parameter inside the callee must match the same local window
- supported references are `tile.load` and `tensor.slice`
- transpose loads are rejected
- the `tile.load` read shape must equal the candidate window shape
- all matched references must agree on window shape and offset
- if any reference is unsupported, the whole input parameter stays full-tensor
- pure input-window shape and callee-local offset expressions may reference only callee params; after call-site substitution, those params may carry outer loop-affine values, and the windowed callee reads relative to `[0, ...]`
- for `PureInputWindowConsumer`, if the matched window is full shape at zero offset, the pass skips it because slicing would not expose a narrower dependency
- for `PureInputWindowConsumer`, callees with no data return stay full-tensor because such consumers may be side-effect or fence tasks whose full input intentionally carries a wider dependency
- input-only `Submit` callsites stay full-tensor; inside `manual_scope`, a full input may intentionally carry a wider dependency even when the callee body reads a local window
- when a callee also has an eligible output-window rewrite, any already proven pure input windows are preserved and materialized at the same callsite
- for `AggregateInputWindowLoop`, all references must be inside one static `ForStmt`, at least one offset dimension must vary with that loop, and the aggregate window must equal the input parent shape; partial aggregate reads such as weight sub-windows remain full-tensor

Non-goals and dependence model:

- the pass does not add explicit dependency edges
- the pass does not reintroduce a later full-parent-read guard
- the pass does not precompute global window descriptor arrays
- the pass does not split SPMD launches or externalize per-block SPMD windows
- unsupported consumers, including full-tensor readers, remain baseline/full-tensor inputs
- `DeriveCallDirections` keeps its existing sound sequential `Out -> InOut` rule; Pattern 5 only exposes proven local windows before that pass runs

### Windowize Opt-in

Pattern 5 is **disabled by default**. It only runs for InCore-type functions
(`InCore`, `AIC`, or `AIV`) that carry the IR attribute `windowize = true`. The
Python DSL currently exposes this attribute through `pl.at(...)`:

```python
with pl.at(level=pl.Level.CORE_GROUP, windowize=True):
    out = self.my_kernel(...)
```

Tests, tools, or handwritten DSL/IR may also attach the same function attr
directly:

```python
@pl.function(type=pl.FunctionType.InCore, attrs={"windowize": True})
def kernel(...):
    ...
```

Only functions explicitly annotated with `windowize=True` are candidates for
Pattern 5. The opt-in is binary and local to that outlined function; there is no
global switch, policy string, or per-direction override. Other frontends or
hand-written IR may use the same function attribute directly. For example,
parser/printer round-trips preserve the attr once it is present on the function.

Use `windowize=True` only when the kernel has a stable local-window access
pattern and the extra call-site slices are expected to expose narrower runtime
dependencies. The pass keeps unsupported cases on the baseline full-tensor path,
but the annotation is still an expert opt-in because it can increase
orchestration and scheduling overhead.

One practical way to find candidates is to inspect the swimlane timeline. A
kernel may benefit when sibling orchestration tasks serialize even though they
operate on different regions of the same tensor. Typical clues are:

- adjacent tasks that could overlap but instead wait on each other
- task gaps that are large compared with the task duration itself
- TensorMap auto-dependency edges between tasks that should only touch disjoint
  windows of the same parent tensor

Windowization makes those local regions explicit with call-site slices and
`__windowed` callees, so runtime dependency analysis can reason about the
actual window descriptors instead of the full parent tensor. The trade-off is
that finer dependencies can also add orchestration work and fragment scheduler
dispatch/completion. If the new overhead dominates the saved serialization, do
not enable `windowize=True` for that kernel.

After enabling it, inspect the generated orchestration for `__windowed` callees
and local `.view(...)`/slice arguments, then compare runtime behavior with and
without the annotation.

## Example (Pattern 1)

**Before**:

```python
@pl.program
class Before:
    @pl.function(type=pl.FunctionType.InCore)
    def compute(self, x: pl.Tensor[[64], pl.FP32],
                out_0: pl.Out[pl.Tensor[[64], pl.FP32]]) -> pl.Tensor[[64], pl.FP32]:
        x_tile = pl.load(x, (0,), (64,))
        y_tile = pl.tile.add(x_tile, x_tile)
        ret = pl.store(y_tile, (0,), out_0)
        return ret

    @pl.function(type=pl.FunctionType.Orchestration)
    def main(self, buf: pl.Tensor[[64], pl.FP32]) -> pl.Tensor[[64], pl.FP32]:
        for i in pl.range(10, init_values=[buf]):
            out_0 = pl.tensor.create((64,), dtype=pl.FP32)
            result = self.compute(iter_arg, out_0)
            pl.yield_(result)
        return loop_result
```

**After** (Pattern 1 merges Out into In as InOut):

```python
@pl.program
class After:
    @pl.function(type=pl.FunctionType.InCore)
    def compute(self, x: pl.InOut[pl.Tensor[[64], pl.FP32]]) -> pl.Tensor[[64], pl.FP32]:
        x_tile = pl.load(x, (0,), (64,))
        y_tile = pl.tile.add(x_tile, x_tile)
        ret = pl.store(y_tile, (0,), x)
        return ret

    @pl.function(type=pl.FunctionType.Orchestration)
    def main(self, buf: pl.Tensor[[64], pl.FP32]) -> pl.Tensor[[64], pl.FP32]:
        for i in pl.range(10, init_values=[buf]):
            result = self.compute(iter_arg)
            pl.yield_(result)
        return loop_result
```

The `tensor.create` is eliminated; the iter-arg buffer is reused across iterations.
