# SkewCrossCorePipeline Pass

Software-pipelines mixed cube/vector (cross-core) `pl.pipeline` loops so the two cores overlap, replacing the legacy unroll+IO-cluster handling of cross-core loops. Runs immediately before [`LowerPipelineLoops`](25-lower_pipeline_loops.md).

## Overview

On A2/A3 a fused cube+vector kernel (e.g. flash-decode `qk_pv`) round-trips through GM: the cube (AIC) sends scores to the vector (AIV) via `tile.tpush_to_aiv` and gets the softmax result back via `tile.tpop_from_aiv`; the vector mirrors this with `tile.tpop_from_aic` / `tile.tpush_to_aic`. Run naively, each core stalls waiting for the other.

The old approach unrolled these loops (`pl.pipeline(stage=F)`) and let `CanonicalizeIOOrder` cluster the cross-core ops — which produced *back-to-back* `tpop`s that serialised the consumer. `SkewCrossCorePipeline` instead software-pipelines the loop:

- **Single round-trip, producer role** — exactly one `tpush` and one `tpop`, and the `tpush`'s backward slice does not feed the body via an SSA edge (the cube: `QK → tpush`, `tpop → SV`). The two halves are linked only by the in-order cross-core FIFO, so the producer runs **`D = max(2, stage-1)` iterations ahead** (cross-core defaults to depth-2): a `produce(start … start+(D-1)·step)` prologue, a `ForKind::Sequential` steady loop whose loop var `k` leads each group and pairs the group's `D` produces `produce(k+i·step)` with the trailing `D` consumes `consume(k-(D-i)·step)`, stepping `k` by `D·step` over `[start+D·step, start+trip·step)`, and a `consume(last D)` epilogue. The cube issues group k's `D` `QK`s while the vector runs group (k-D)'s `D` softmaxes. See [Skew depth](#skew-depth-stage) for `D` selection and the buffer-separation it buys.
- **Consumer role, or multi-round-trip** — the lead op feeds the body via SSA (the vector: the popped scores feed softmax), or there is more than one message per FIFO direction. The loop is **demoted to a plain `ForKind::Sequential` loop** (body unchanged). This drops the unroll's back-to-back `tpop` while preserving the in-order FIFO; cross-core overlap then comes from the *peer* core's producer skew putting each tile in the FIFO a step early, so the in-order `tpop` never blocks.

Every **non-cross-core** pipeline loop (same-core GM→L1, L1→L0, nested matmul stage loops — no `tpush`/`tpop`) is left untouched for `LowerPipelineLoops` to replicate.

The output is `ForKind::Sequential` with no `pipeline_stages` marker, so `LowerPipelineLoops` (triggers on `kind == Pipeline`) skips it and `CanonicalizeIOOrder` (scoped to pipeline bodies) does not re-sort the hand-ordered skew.

**Requires**: SSAForm, SplitIncoreOrch, IncoreTileOps, TileOps2D, TileMemoryInferred, NormalizedStmtStructure.

**Pipeline position**: After [`NormalizeReturnOrder`](23-normalize_return_order.md), immediately before [`LowerPipelineLoops`](25-lower_pipeline_loops.md). Nothing runs between them, so a cross-core loop is skewed (→ Sequential) before the unroll pass can replicate it.

## API

```python
from pypto import passes
p = passes.skew_cross_core_pipeline()
```

## Behavior

For a `ForStmt(kind=Pipeline, attrs={"pipeline_stages": F})` with `F > 1`:

1. **Non-cross-core** — body lacks a `tpush`/`tpop` pair → left intact as `ForKind::Pipeline` for `LowerPipelineLoops` to replicate.
2. **Cross-core** — body has both a `tpush` and a `tpop`. Find the lead (first cross-core op in program order), backward-slice it into the producer half, and classify:
   - one `tpush` + one `tpop`, `carried` (lead-defined vars used by the body) empty, statically skewable → **producer skew** (prologue / Sequential steady loop / epilogue).
   - otherwise — `carried` non-empty (consumer role), more than one `tpush`/`tpop` (multi-round-trip; skewing one message would reorder the in-order FIFO — a silent wrong-data bug the verifiers don't catch), dynamic bounds, or trip < 2 → **`DemoteToSequential`**.

Either way a cross-core loop **always** leaves this pass as `ForKind::Sequential` with no `pipeline_stages` marker, so it never reaches `LowerPipelineLoops` or `CanonicalizeIOOrder` as a Pipeline body.

### Skew depth (`stage`)

Cross-core producer skew needs **at least depth 2**: the two pipeline stages (e.g. the cube's two QK matmuls) must land on separate L1/L0 buffers, or `MemoryReuse` coalesces them onto one and serialises the cube. So the **requested** depth is

```text
D = max(2, stage - 1)
```

— depth-2 by default, and the standard pipeline meaning `stage - 1` only once that exceeds 2 (i.e. `stage >= 4`). Each steady iteration emits **`D` produces then `D` consumes** (the steady loop is unrolled by `D`):

| `stage` | depth `D` | steady body |
| ------- | --------- | ----------- |
| 2, 3 | 2 | `produce(k); produce(k+step); consume(k-2·step); consume(k-step)` |
| 4 | 3 | `produce(k … k+2·step); consume(k-3·step … k-step)` |

The **effective** depth needs `trip % D == 0` and `trip >= 2·D`; when the requested `D` fails this the pass uses the **largest feasible `D' <= D`** — down to `1` (the classic produce-one-ahead skew) for an incompatible trip such as an odd one. The `D` distinct produce tiles and `D` distinct consume tiles per iteration keep the two pipeline stages off a single L1/L0 buffer — a depth-1 cube QK/SV pair sharing one Mat buffer is exactly what serialised the two matmuls.

`iter_args` (e.g. flash-attention `mi/li/oi` accumulators) thread sequentially through the prologue → the `D` consumes per steady iteration → the epilogue; the producer half is iter-arg-transparent.

## Constraints

- Static bounds only for the skew (`start`, `stop`, `step` compile-time). Dynamic-bound cross-core loops bail to the unroll path.
- The producer-skew steady region is **kept as a loop** (not fully unrolled) so the matmul `Acc` double-buffering assigned by `AllocateMemoryAddr` still has a loop to alternate over.
- A true consumer-side prefetch is intentionally **not** done: it would break codegen's `tpop → tfree` FIFO-slot tracking (keyed on SSA var identity, cannot cross an iter_arg) and a blocking `tpop` issued a full iteration early would simply stall.

## Limitations

- **Multi-round-trip loops are not skewed yet (TODO).** A loop with more than one
  message per FIFO direction (e.g. `C→V→C→V` = `tpush, tpop, tpush, tpop`) is
  currently **demoted to `ForKind::Sequential`**, not software-pipelined. Skewing
  only the lead message would reorder the in-order cross-core FIFO and silently
  feed the peer the wrong tile (the property verifiers do not model FIFO order),
  so the conservative demote is correct but leaves overlap on the table. A
  future revision should skew the whole FIFO group together (advance every
  message by one round-trip) so multi-round-trip producers overlap too.

## Examples

```python
# Producer role, stage=2 (the default → depth-2) — SKEWED, 2 produces then 2 consumes
# Before: for i in pl.pipeline(0, 8, 1, stage=2):  (qk; tpush; tpop; sv; store)
# After:  produce(0); produce(1)                   # prologue (2 QKs primed)
#         for k in pl.range(2, 8, 2):              # steady (Sequential, unroll-2)
#             produce(k); produce(k+1)             # cube QK[k], QK[k+1]  -> tpush, tpush
#             consume(k-2); consume(k-1)           # tpop, SV[k-2]; tpop, SV[k-1]
#         consume(6); consume(7)                   # epilogue
# The two QKs and two SVs use distinct Mat buffers, so MemoryReuse cannot collapse
# them onto one buffer and serialise the cube (the fa_fused_aic over-reuse).
```

```python
# Odd trip (depth-2 infeasible: 3 % 2 != 0) → falls back to depth-1
# Before: for i in pl.pipeline(0, 3, 1, stage=2):
# After:  produce(0)                              # prologue
#         for i in pl.range(1, 3, 1):             # steady (Sequential)
#             produce(i); consume(i-1)            # cube QK[i] overlaps vec softmax[i-1]
#         consume(2)                              # epilogue
```

```python
# Consumer role / multi-round-trip — DEMOTED to Sequential
# Before: for i in pl.pipeline(0, 4, 1, stage=2):  (tpop; softmax; tpush; store)
# After:  for i in pl.range(0, 4, 1):              # body unchanged, FIFO order preserved
```
