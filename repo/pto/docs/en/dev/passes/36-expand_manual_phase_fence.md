# ExpandManualPhaseFence Pass

## Overview

`ExpandManualPhaseFence` compresses profitable full-array `TaskId`
dependencies carried by explicit manual-scope deps. It is a narrow
orchestration-only pass: when a manual-scope consumer fanout depends on one
stable, read-only `Array[TASK_ID]`, the pass inserts one dependency-only
`system.task_dummy` barrier and rewrites the covered consumers to depend on the
barrier `TaskId`.

The dependency shape changes from repeated all-to-all fanout:

```text
tids[N] -> consumers[M]
```

to one explicit phase fence:

```text
tids[N] -> system.task_dummy -> consumers[M]
```

The pass does not change kernel execution semantics. It only rewrites the
typed `Submit::deps_` field on selected consumer `Submit`s and adds the marked
dummy-task call that codegen lowers to `rt_submit_dummy_task(...)`. After
outlining, this covers manual-scope task launches uniformly: both
`pl.submit(..., deps=[...])` and `pl.at(..., deps=[...])` shapes are
represented as `Submit` nodes with typed `deps_` — a plain `Call` never
carries `manual_dep_edges` (ManualDepsOnSubmitOnly invariant), so `Submit`s
are the only dep consumers this pass inspects.

## Position in the pipeline

```text
... -> DeriveCallDirections -> AutoDeriveTaskDependencies -> ExpandManualPhaseFence -> SynthesizeAllReduceSignals -> MaterializeCommDomainScopes -> LowerHostTensorCollectives -> Simplify (final)
```

`DeriveCallDirections` must run first so call-like nodes carry resolved
`arg_directions` and parser/outline-produced `Submit::deps_` edges are already
visible. `ExpandManualPhaseFence` runs before the final distributed metadata
collection and before orchestration codegen observes the dep edges (codegen
reads them through the transient `SubmitToCallView`, which surfaces `deps_`
as a synthesised `manual_dep_edges` attr).

## Algorithm

For each orchestration function, the pass visits `RuntimeScopeStmt(manual=true)`
regions and analyzes each loop body:

1. **Find candidate arrays.** A candidate consumer must be a `Submit` with
   exactly one `deps_` entry, and that entry must be an `Array[TASK_ID]`.
2. **Estimate benefit.** The pass compares direct fanout (`N * M`) with the
   barrier shape (`N + M`). Low-benefit shapes such as `N -> 1` and `2 -> 2`
   stay direct.
3. **Reject unsafe shapes.** The pass skips mixed deps, scalar deps, unresolved
   arrays, current loop iter-arg arrays, body-defined arrays, arrays updated
   through same-storage `Array[TASK_ID]` aliases, non-manual scopes, and
   non-orchestration functions.
4. **Insert a barrier.** For a profitable safe candidate, the pass creates a
   fresh `Scalar[TASK_ID]` variable and assigns it from `system.task_dummy` with
   `attrs["dummy_task"] = true` and `attrs["manual_dep_edges"] = [source_array]`
   (the sanctioned op-call carrier of the attr — the barrier itself is never a
   consumer).
5. **Rewrite consumers.** Covered consumer `Submit`s are rebuilt with
   `deps_ = [barrier_tid]`, preserving Submit-ness and leaving args and attrs
   unchanged.

For both sequential and parallel loops, accepted barriers are inserted before
the rewritten loop. This keeps stable sequential dependencies at one dummy
submission per loop instead of one per iteration. Sequential loops with a known
zero trip count do not emit a barrier.

The safety index is conservative. It includes nested loop `return_vars_`,
nested body updates, and transitive `Array[TASK_ID]` iter-arg alias classes.
Nested loop summaries are cached and merged into parent loop analysis, so the
pass does not rescan the same nested body for each candidate dependency array.
`pl.parallel` does not weaken explicit `manual_scope` dependencies: if the body
reads `deps=[tids]` and also updates `tids[branch]` or an alias of `tids`, the
pass keeps direct deps.

## Fallback boundaries

The pass intentionally leaves the existing direct dependency lowering path in
place unless the pattern is clear, safe, and profitable.

Compressed:

- full-array manual-scope fanout with positive estimated edge savings;
- double-buffered phase fences where the body reads one `Array[TASK_ID]` and
  writes a different carrier such as `tids_next`.

Left direct:

- scalar TaskId deps;
- mixed scalar + array deps;
- multiple-array deps;
- partial-slot deps such as `prev = tids[i]; deps=[prev]`;
- current loop iter-arg arrays;
- arrays defined or updated inside the same loop body;
- arrays updated through transitive `Array[TASK_ID]` iter-arg aliases;
- nested loop return variables used as dependency arrays;
- known-zero loops;
- low-benefit fanout such as `N -> 1` or `2 -> 2`;
- non-manual scopes and non-orchestration functions.

## Output invariants

After the pass:

- every inserted barrier is a `system.task_dummy` call marked with
  `attrs["dummy_task"] = true`;
- the barrier call keeps the original full-array dependency in
  `attrs["manual_dep_edges"]`;
- rewritten consumers are `Submit`s whose `deps_` holds the barrier `TaskId`,
  not the original array;
- fallback shapes retain their original `Submit::deps_`;
- no plain cross-function `Call` carries `manual_dep_edges`
  (ManualDepsOnSubmitOnly holds before and after the pass);
- `arg_directions` remain resolved and are not recomputed by this pass.
