# LowerCompositeOps Pass

Decomposes composite tile / distributed ops into compositions of primitive tile ops (`tile.muls`, `tile.adds`, `tile.add`, `tile.sub`, `tile.mul`, `tile.cast`) and distributed primitives, so codegen never has to emit a high-level intrinsic. Today the pass handles `tile.sin` / `tile.cos` (FP32 Cody-Waite + Horner) and `pld.tensor.*` distributed collectives (`allreduce` (mesh and ring), `allgather`, `reduce_scatter`, `broadcast`, `barrier`). New composite ops add a lowering rule to the dispatch table inside the pass file without touching the dispatcher.

## Overview

`LowerCompositeOps` is a function-level pass that rewrites every `var = Call(...)` `AssignStmt` whose callee appears in the pass's lowering dispatch table. For `tile.sin` / `tile.cos`, the rule emits a fixed-shape primitive tile-op recipe using `tile.muls`, `tile.adds`, `tile.add`, `tile.sub`, `tile.mul`, and `tile.cast`: Cody-Waite range reduction (4-part π split) followed by a degree-9 odd Horner polynomial. For `pld.tensor.*` distributed collectives, the rules emit the cross-rank recipes documented below; `pld.tensor.allreduce` remains explicit-signal in InCore/composite lowering. The original target `Var` is preserved as the LHS of the final `AssignStmt`, so downstream uses keep the same name and identity.

Host-orchestrator `pld.tensor.allreduce` calls are skipped by this pass: `SynthesizeAllReduceSignals` first normalizes optional-signal host calls to the explicit-signal form, `MaterializeCommDomainScopes` places the data and signal windows into comm domains, and then `LowerHostTensorCollectives` lowers them to internal builtin dispatches.

The pass is **FP32-only**. Non-FP32 inputs are rejected at op-construction time by the shared `DeduceTileFP32OnlyType` deducer (see `src/ir/op/tile_ops/unary.cpp:94`), so the lowering pass itself only sees well-typed FP32 operands and never has to fail on dtype.

The pass is **structural no-op** on programs that contain no registered composite call such as `tile.sin`, `tile.cos`, or `pld.tensor.*` distributed collectives: every other statement passes through `IRMutator::VisitStmt_`. The decomposition emits only primitive tile ops (`tile.muls`, `tile.adds`, `tile.add`, `tile.sub`, `tile.mul`, `tile.cast`) and distributed primitives, none of which the mutator rewrites — so the pass is also **idempotent**.

**Requires**: nothing.

**Produces**: nothing.

**Invalidates**: nothing.

The empty `PassProperties` contract (`kLowerCompositeOpsProperties` in `include/pypto/ir/transforms/pass_properties.h`) reflects that the lowering operates purely within the existing tile-op vocabulary (`tile.muls`, `tile.adds`, `tile.add`, `tile.sub`, `tile.mul`, `tile.cast`) — it neither establishes nor breaks any `IRProperty`.

## When It Runs

`LowerCompositeOps` is the **first entry of `tile_pto_passes`** in the `Default` pipeline (see `python/pypto/ir/pass_manager.py`), running immediately after `ConvertTensorToTileOps` (slot 12) and `OptimizeOrchTensors` (slot 13). At this point all tensor-level transcendental calls (`tensor.sin`, `tensor.cos`) have been rewritten to their tile equivalents (`tile.sin`, `tile.cos`) by the conversion registry, and the tile pipeline is about to start tile-shape canonicalisation. Lowering trig before `FlattenTileNdTo2D` keeps the decomposition independent of the 2D-flattening rules — every primitive tile op in the recipe (`tile.muls`, `tile.adds`, `tile.add`, `tile.sub`, `tile.mul`, `tile.cast`) has well-defined behaviour at any rank.

## Architecture

The pass is a single translation unit, `src/ir/transforms/lower_composite_ops_pass.cpp`:

```text
src/ir/transforms/lower_composite_ops_pass.cpp
  LoweringBuilder           — per-call scratchpad (Bind + primitive tile-op builders:
                              tile.muls, tile.adds, tile.add, tile.sub, tile.mul, tile.cast
                              + structured control-flow: EmitFor / EmitForReduce
                              / EmitIf / EmitIfExpr + NotEq scalar guard)
  CompositeLoweringFn       — (call, visited_args, builder) -> result expr
  Lower<Op>Rule             — one rule function per composite op (LowerSinRule,
                              LowerCosRule, LowerTensorAllReduceRule, ...)
  LookupCompositeRule       — file-local op-name → rule dispatch table (kRules)
  LowerCompositeOpsMutator  — walks the function, looks up a rule per Call
```

Adding a new composite op (all edits stay in `lower_composite_ops_pass.cpp`):

1. Write a `Lower<Op>Rule(call, args, builder)` function. It receives the original `CallPtr` (use `call->span_`, `call->kwargs_`, `call->op_->name_` as needed), the visited arg expressions (var-remap already applied), and a `LoweringBuilder` whose `Bind` helper appends an `AssignStmt` per intermediate temp. For rules that need control flow, use `builder.EmitFor` / `builder.EmitForReduce` / `builder.EmitIf` / `builder.EmitIfExpr` — each takes a body callback that receives a nested builder sharing the same temp counter, so emitted temps stay uniquely named regardless of nesting depth. `LowerTensorAllReduceRule` is the canonical example of a control-flow-bearing rule (4-phase notify / wait / remote_load+accumulate / store for mesh; `LowerTensorRingAllReduceRule` adds a chunked RS+AG ring schedule dispatched via a `mode` kwarg).
2. Add a `{"<op>", &Lower<Op>Rule}` row to `kRules` inside `LookupCompositeRule`.

No edits to the mutator are needed. When the table grows past a handful of entries — or a rule wants its own translation unit — promote it back to a standalone registry under `src/ir/transforms/composite_ops/`.

## Algorithm (sin / cos rule)

`LowerSinCos` in `src/ir/transforms/lower_composite_ops_pass.cpp` is parameterised on `is_cos`. The mutator overrides `VisitStmt_(const AssignStmtPtr&)` (rather than `VisitCall`) because each trig op expands to ~33 statements and each statement needs a fresh temp `Var`. Working at the statement level lets the rule append directly to the surrounding sequence via the builder.

### Range Reduction (Cody-Waite, 4-part π split)

The goal is to express `x = k·π + t` (sin) or `x = k·π + π/2 + t` (cos) with `t ∈ [-π/2, π/2]` and `k` an integer. FP32 cannot represent π exactly, so a single `x - k·π_fp32` carries a relative error of ~1e-7 per multiplication, which range-reduction error inflates linearly with `|k|`. Cody-Waite splits π into a fast-rounding head plus three (here four) small corrections so the residual cancellation only loses bits at the finest scales:

```text
π ≈ PI_V2 + PI_C1 + PI_C2 + PI_C3 + PI_C4
```

`t` is computed as a chain of subtractions, each consuming one part:

```text
t0 = x  - k_f * PI_V2
t1 = t0 - k_f * PI_C1
t2 = t1 - k_f * PI_C2
t3 = t2 - k_f * PI_C3
t4 = t3 - k_f * PI_C4
```

For **sin**, `k_f = float(round(x · PI_INV))` using `tile.cast` mode `ROUND` (round-to-nearest, ties away from zero). For **cos**, the rounding is shifted by `0.5` so `k` represents the multiple of `π` whose midpoint lies near `x`:

```text
k_f = float(rint(x · PI_INV + 0.5))   ; mode RINT (round-half-to-even)
```

The cos path also adds `π/2` mid-reduction, split as `PI_HALF_HEAD + PI_HALF_TAIL` (Cody-Waite again). `PI_HALF_HEAD` is folded between `PI_C1` and `PI_C2`, `PI_HALF_TAIL` after `PI_C4`, so that each addition shares the magnitude scale of the surrounding subtractions and the catastrophic-cancellation regime is shared across all 5+2 corrections.

### Sign Computation

Once `k` is known as a float, the sign is computed without any conditional:

```text
sign = floor(k_f / 2) · 4 + k_f · (-2) + 1
     = (-1)^k
```

The identity `floor(k/2)·4 - 2·k + 1` evaluates to `+1` for even `k` and `-1` for odd `k`. To see this, write `k = 2m + r` with `r ∈ {0, 1}`:

```text
floor(k/2) = m
floor(k/2)·4 - 2·k + 1 = 4m - 2(2m + r) + 1 = 1 - 2r
```

which is `+1` when `r = 0` and `-1` when `r = 1`. The pass implements this in 6 ops:

```text
half_k     = k_f * 0.5
floor_hk_i = int32(floor(half_k))         ; tile.cast mode FLOOR
floor_hk_f = float(floor_hk_i)
floor_x4   = floor_hk_f * 4.0
neg2_k     = k_f * (-2.0)
sign_pre   = floor_x4 + neg2_k
sign       = sign_pre + 1.0
```

### Horner Polynomial

`sin(t)` for `t ∈ [-π/2, π/2]` is approximated by a degree-9 odd polynomial `t · P(t²)`, where:

```text
P(u) = (((R0·u + R1)·u + R2)·u + R3)·u + 1
```

The leading `1` constant in `P(u)` corresponds to the `t¹` coefficient of the Taylor series, and `R3 ≈ -1/6`, `R2 ≈ 1/120`, `R1 ≈ -1/5040`, `R0 ≈ 1/362880` correspond to the higher odd-power coefficients tuned for minimax accuracy on `[-π/2, π/2]`. Implementation:

```text
t2     = t * t
p_r0   = t2 * R0
p_r1   = p_r0 + R1
p_t2_r1= p_r1 * t2
p_r2   = p_t2_r1 + R2
p_t2_r2= p_r2 * t2
p_r3   = p_t2_r2 + R3
p_t2_r3= p_r3 * t2
p_one  = p_t2_r3 + 1.0
t_p    = t * p_one
out    = sign * t_p
```

The same polynomial is used for both sin and cos: the cos path differs only in the range reduction, so by the time `t` enters the polynomial it already lies in `[-π/2, π/2]` and the polynomial does not need separate coefficients.

### Sin vs Cos at a Glance

| Step | sin | cos |
| ---- | --- | --- |
| 1. k rounding | `round(x · 1/π)` (mode `ROUND`) | `rint(x · 1/π + 0.5)` (mode `RINT`) |
| 2. range reduction | `x - k·π` (4-part) | `x - k·π + π/2` (4-part + 2-part π/2) |
| 3. sign | `(-1)^k` | `(-1)^k` (same identity, different `k`) |
| 4. Horner | `t · P(t²)` | `t · P(t²)` (same polynomial) |
| 5. result | `sign · t · P(t²)` | `sign · t · P(t²)` |

## Constants

All constants are FP32 literals (the `k*` literals near the top of `src/ir/transforms/lower_composite_ops_pass.cpp`, matching the framework reference at `gitcode.com/cann/pypto:framework/src/interface/tileop/vector/unary.h`):

`tile.cast` round modes (mirrors `src/ir/op/tile_ops/unary.cpp` registration):

## Numerical Properties

- **Absolute error**: ≤ ~1e-5 over `|x| ≤ 2π · 1024` (validated against NumPy by `tests/ut/ir/transforms/test_lower_composite_ops_numerical.py`). Inside one period, `max abs error` observed is ~1 ulp ≈ 1.19e-7.
- **Range-reduction breakdown**: beyond `|x| ≈ 2^17`, the FP32 representation of `x` itself loses fractional precision, so range-reduction error dominates regardless of how many π-correction terms are used. The 4-part Cody-Waite split chosen here is the standard CANN/PyPTO recipe and matches the reference implementation's behaviour on every tested `x` magnitude.
- **dtype**: FP32-only. FP16, BF16, and integer inputs are rejected at op-construction time (well before the pass runs) — see `tests/ut/ir/operators/test_tensor_ops.py` (tensor.sin/cos rejection) and `tests/ut/ir/operators/test_tile_ops.py` (tile.sin/cos rejection) for the rejection cases.
- **NaN/Inf**: NaN inputs propagate to NaN output (the polynomial preserves NaN). Inf inputs produce indeterminate values because the range-reduction `k = round(x/π)` step overflows; this matches the documented `|x| ≤ 2^17` validity range.

## Idempotency

Running `LowerCompositeOps` twice produces identical IR after the first run: the tile recipes emit only `tile.muls`, `tile.adds`, `tile.add`, `tile.sub`, `tile.mul`, and `tile.cast`, while the distributed recipes emit only the distributed primitives listed below. The mutator only rewrites registered composite calls (`tile.sin`, `tile.cos`, `pld.tensor.*` distributed collectives, ...), so the second invocation visits the body and changes nothing. This is verified by the sin/cos and distributed-collective idempotency tests in `tests/ut/ir/transforms/test_lower_composite_ops.py`.

## `pld.tensor.*` distributed collectives

The pass also lowers the `pld.tensor.*` family of window-bound distributed collectives. Each collective is a single composite `Call` that expands into a notify / wait + data-movement recipe. The data-movement primitive differs by op: `allgather` and `broadcast` relocate window data with `pld.tile.get` (a GM→GM bulk copy through a VEC staging tile), while `allreduce` and `reduce_scatter` pull peer chunks into a UB tile with `pld.tile.remote_load` and accumulate with `tile.add`. The rules share the same signal-buffer discipline: a window-bound INT32 `signal` matrix is used as a cross-rank barrier, and the buffer is **single-shot per call**.

### `pld.tensor.allreduce`

The allreduce rule decomposes one composite call into two cross-rank barriers reusing the same `signal` cells: Phase 2a `Set 1` + Phase 2b `wait ≥1`, then Phase 3.5a `AtomicAdd 1` + Phase 3.5b `wait ≥2`. By the time the call returns, every cell sits at `2` rather than its initial `0`.

**Signal buffers must NOT be reused for back-to-back allreduce calls.** A stale `2` in any cell would let the next call's Phase 2b `wait ≥1` pass immediately on the leftover value, breaking the barrier and racing the next Phase 3 reads against the previous reduction's Phase 4 writes. Callers issuing multiple allreduces must allocate a fresh signal buffer (via `alloc_window_buffer` + `window`) for each call. The user-facing DSL docstring at `python/pypto/language/distributed/op/tensor_ops.py::allreduce` carries the same warning.

`kGe` (not `kEq`) is the load-bearing choice for both wait predicates. The cell is monotonically increasing within a single call, but a slow rank's first poll may already see the cell past `1` if a faster peer has completed Phase 3 (microseconds-long remote loads) and started Phase 3.5a. `kEq(==1)` would then deadlock; `kGe(≥1)` does not. The hand-written reference at `tests/st/distributed/test_l3_allreduce.py` uses `Ge(1)` for the same reason.

Only `ReduceOp::kSum` is supported in the first version; the C++ deducer rejects `Max` / `Min` / `Prod`.

### `pld.tensor.allgather`

Signature: `allgather(local_data, target, signal, out)`. `local_data` is this rank's chunk (`Tensor` or `Tile` `[1, SIZE]`), `target` is a window-bound `DistributedTensor[NR, SIZE]` staging area, `signal` is the INT32 barrier, and `out` is a plain `Tensor[1, NR*SIZE]` that receives the result. Decomposes into a recipe aligned with the simpler allgather reference (`simpler/examples/workers/l3/allgather_distributed/`):

- Phase 0: `tile.load(local_data, [0, 0], [1, SIZE])` — emit a Tile from the plain input when `local_data` is a `Tensor`; skipped when it is already a Tile
- Phase 1: `tile.store(stage_tile, [0, 0], target)` — stage this rank's chunk into its private HCCL window at local row 0
- Phase 2a: notify-all (`Set 1`)
- Phase 2b: wait-all (`Ge 1`)
- Phase 3: for `r` in `0..NR-1`, `pld.tile.get(out, peer=r, target, stage, dst_offsets=[0, r*SIZE], src_offsets=[0, 0], shape=[1, SIZE])` — transfer each peer's chunk directly into `out` at column offset `[0, r*SIZE]` through one shared `[1, SIZE]` VEC staging tile. No `tile.concat`; each transfer is `[1, SIZE]` so it fits in UB for any `NR`/`SIZE`. Returns the `out` **Tensor** `[1, NR*SIZE]`.

Self-read falls out of the same `pld.tile.get` path via HCCL identity mapping (`CommRemotePtr` returns local pointer for `peer == my_rank`). Every rank produces the identical rank-ordered concatenation in `out`.

### `pld.tensor.reduce_scatter`

Decomposes into the same 5-phase shape as `allreduce`:

- Phase 2a: notify-all (`Set 1`)
- Phase 2b: wait-all (`Ge 1`)
- Phase 3: for each peer, `remote_load` chunk `r` from peer `p` and accumulate into a local scratch with `tile.add`
- Phase 3.5a: re-notify (`AtomicAdd 1`)
- Phase 3.5b: re-wait (`Ge 2`)
- Phase 4: `tile.store` the reduced chunk `r` back into `target[r, 0:SIZE]`

`target` has shape `[NR, SIZE]`; each rank stages all `NR` chunks before the call. After the call, rank `r`'s row `[r, 0:SIZE]` holds the element-wise sum of chunk `r` across all ranks. The post-reduce barrier is required for the same WAR reason as `allreduce`.

Only `ReduceOp::kSum` is supported in the first version; the C++ deducer rejects `Max` / `Min` / `Prod`.

### `pld.tensor.broadcast`

Decomposes into a 3-phase recipe:

- Phase 2a: notify-all (`Set 1`)
- Phase 2b: wait-all (`Ge 1`)
- Phase 3: `tile.create` (VEC staging tile) + `pld.tile.get(target, peer=root, target, stage)` on every rank — each rank reads root's slice into its own `target`. For `peer == root` the HCCL identity mapping makes the get a local no-op, so root keeps its own data while non-root ranks receive root's.

`root` is a static `int` kwarg known at compile time.

### `pld.tensor.barrier`

Pure synchronization — no data movement. Decomposes into a 2-phase recipe:

- Phase 2a: notify-all (`Set 1`)
- Phase 2b: wait-all (`Ge 1`)

The returned expression is the same `signal` tensor, enabling the rebind idiom `signal = pld.tensor.barrier(signal)`.

### Signal-buffer discipline

All distributed rules use `kGe` (not `kEq`) for wait predicates. The cell is monotonically increasing within a single call, but a slow rank's first poll may already see the cell past the threshold if a faster peer has finished its Phase-3 data movement and started the next notify. `kEq` would deadlock in that case; `kGe` does not. A self-resetting variant (Set 0 / Eq 0 at the end of a call) is blocked on PTOAS issue #797.

## Implementation Notes

The mutator overrides `VisitStmt_(const AssignStmtPtr&)` rather than `VisitCall` because the decomposition splices ~33 statements per trig op into the surrounding sequence. Doing the splice from inside `VisitCall` would require returning multiple expressions, which `IRMutator` does not support; doing it from `VisitStmt_` lets `LowerSinCos` build a `vector<StmtPtr>` and return either a single bound `AssignStmt` or a fresh `SeqStmts`.

Each intermediate result is bound to a fresh `Var` named via `auto_name::BuildName` with the user's target name as the base. The mutator's `temp_counter_` is shared (by reference, through each `LoweringBuilder`) across all trig ops in a function so distinct ops do not collide on temp names.

The cast modes `RINT` (cos), `ROUND` (sin), `FLOOR` (sign), and `None` (int↔float) come from the tile-op registry's enum (`src/ir/op/tile_ops/unary.cpp`). Choosing the correct mode is load-bearing: `ROUND` for sin's `k` keeps `k` symmetric around zero so the Horner polynomial sees evenly distributed `t`; `RINT` for cos's `k` matches the `+0.5` shift and ensures even `k` corresponds to even multiples of `π/2`.
