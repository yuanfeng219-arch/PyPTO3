 * @brief Classify ForStmt iter_arg carries and size TaskId array carries
 *
 * An Orchestration ``ForStmt`` iter_arg lowers one of two ways:
 *  - **trivial**: the yield value aliases the iter_arg (same backing buffer), so
 *    iter_arg and return_var share the init value's emit name. Materialising a
 *    fresh ``Tensor`` would break the runtime dependency tracker, which keys off
 *    ``Tensor*`` identity.
 *  - **rebind**: the yield value is a different buffer, so a mutable carry
 *    variable is declared and the yield assigns back to it (issue #1286).
 *
 * Inside a ``pl.manual_scope`` a ``Scalar[TASK_ID]`` carry additionally lowers to
 * a ``PTO2TaskId[N]`` array whose extent N comes from the loop's (or a threaded
 * inner loop's) constant trip count.
 *
 * The orchestration codegen used to derive both from an alias-equivalence
 * fixpoint over the loop body. This pass moves that analysis into the IR: it
 * stamps ``iter_arg_rebind_<i>`` (bool, every slot) and ``iter_arg_array_size_<i>``
 * (int, positive extents only) onto ``ForStmt::attrs_``, and codegen degenerates
 * to an attr read. Only ``FunctionType::Orchestration`` functions are touched.
