/**
 * @brief Pick the minimum-wall L0 GEMM design point under the roofline model.
 *
 * Scores the roofline cost model (see DESIGN_SPACE.md in the pto-isa cost-model
 * study) over the design space and returns the minimum-wall design point
 *   P = (m, n, k, stationarity, dbA, dbB, dbC),
 * where dbA / dbB are derived from `stationarity` (moving operand -> depth 2,
 * stationary -> depth 1) and prefetch depth is fixed at <= 2 (no multistage).
 * A "realizable mask" (the allow_* gates) restricts which points may be emitted;
 * it defaults to today's realizable subset {output-stationary, dbC = 1}, so a
 * caller that opens no gate gets exactly the algorithm the pass realizes now.
 *
 *   1. Enumerate the allowed (stationarity, dbC) combinations. For each, derive
 *      the operand depths and L0 budgets:
 *        A0 = L0A/(bytes_a*dbA), B0 = L0B/(bytes_b*dbB), C0 = L0C/(bytes_c*dbC).
 *   2. Enumerate every legal aligned (m, n) with m*n <= C0, and for each (m, n)
 *      every legal aligned k (m*k <= A0, n*k <= B0, k >= min_k; k | K when neither
 *      padding nor k_boundary; plus k == K when the full K fits one block). ALL k
 *      are scored -- ceil(K/k)*ceil(k/kt) is non-monotone in k when kt != align_k,
 *      so the largest legal k is not always wall-optimal.
 *   3. Score each tile by wall (cycles):
 *        C_mad  = ceil(M/m)*ceil(N/n) *
 *                 (ceil(K/k)*mad_head + cpr*ceil(m/16)*Kfrac*ceil(n/16))
 *          Kfrac = floor(K/k)*ceil(k/kt) + ceil((K - floor(K/k)*k)/kt)
 *                  (the K-peel tail is scored at its own width, not rounded to k)
 *        C_drain = ceil(M/m)*ceil(N/n) *
 *                  (drain_fixed + m*(max(drain_row, bytes_c*n/BW_drain) + drain_penalty*(odd(N1)-1)))

 *                   cost = max(floor, throughput) [floor drain_row for narrow N,
 *                   byte throughput for wide N] plus the misalignment residual
 *                   odd(N1)-1 -- N1 = ceil(n/N0), N0 = drain_c0_bytes/bytes_c = 8
 *                   (fp32 L0C); M/N-split adds drains, K-split does not)
 *        C_load (BW-weighted, by stationarity):
 *          OS full-K : min(held-A, held-B) route (hoist the cheaper operand; the
 *                      recorded os_holds_a drives the emit) — held-A / held-B as below
 *          OS split-K: ba*M*K*ceil(N/n)/BW_A + bb*K*N*ceil(M/m)/BW_B  (both re-streamed)
 *          A-stat    : ba*M*K/BW_A           + bb*K*N*ceil(M/m)/BW_B   (k==K, held-A)
 *          B-stat    : ba*M*K*ceil(N/n)/BW_A + bb*K*N/BW_B             (k==K, held-B)
 *        wall   = max(C_load, C_mad) + C_drain        (dbC == 1, drain exposed)
 *               = max(C_load, C_mad, C_drain)         (dbC == 2, drain hidden)
 *      with kt = mad_k_fractal_bytes/bytes_a, cpr = bytes_a/2. Ties break by lex
 *      (padded_compute, ceil(K/k), C_load, -m*n, -k) -- the C_load key picks the
 *      lower-hidden-load aspect among MAD-bound (m,n)<->(n,m) ties.
 *   4. Pick the global minimum-wall point across all enumerated combinations.
 *      A-stationary / B-stationary require k == K (operand residency). dbC = 2
 *      additionally requires a >= 2x2 grid, k == K, and that the single-L0C
 *      optimum already tiles. The
 *      (m, n) grid is bounded by m*n <= C0 and the operand caps, k by K/align_k:
 *      O((C0/align^2) * (K/align_k)) per matmul -- a hardware constant, independent
 *      of IR size; the chooser runs once per matmul op, so the pass stays linear
 *      in the IR.
 *
 * @param cfg All inputs (problem dims + hardware + realizable-mask gates).
 * @return Chosen design point and metadata. Throws ValueError if the inputs
 *   are invalid (e.g., non-positive dims, capacities too small to fit any
 *   legal tile).
