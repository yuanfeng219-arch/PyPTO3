/**
 * @brief Dataflow dependency graph over the top-level statements of a region.
 *
 * Nodes are the region's top-level statements:
 *   - If the region is a SeqStmts, each child of `stmts_` becomes a node.
 *   - Otherwise the region itself is the single node.
 *
 * Edges are predecessor relationships at block granularity: a compound child
 * (IfStmt/ForStmt/...) aggregates all the variable uses and defs from its
 * subtree. `predecessors[X]` is the set of nodes whose defs X directly reads.
 *
 * The graph is sound under the InOut-use discipline (RFC #1026): physical
 * memory mutation is mirrored by SSA version changes, so SSA def-use captures
 * all real dependencies. `BuildStmtDependencyGraph` enforces this
 * precondition when a program is supplied; callers that bypass that path
 * must ensure the discipline holds before relying on the graph for soundness.

/**
 * @brief Check that the InOut-use discipline (RFC #1026) holds over a region.
 *
 * The discipline: for any user-function call that passes variable `v` as an
 * InOut or Out parameter, `v` must not be read by any statement reachable
 * from the call in CFG order. Post-mutation values flow exclusively through
 * the call's return slots.
 *
 * InOut and Out are treated identically — both cause `v` to be "dead for read"
 * after the call.
 *
 * Built-in ops (tile.*, tensor.*, system.*) do not contribute to the dead set
 * here; their memory mutations are handled separately (Mode B in RFC #1026)
 * and are out of scope for this dataflow analysis.
 *
 * Aborts compilation on any violation: a violating region breaks the
 * dataflow-soundness precondition that `BuildStmtDependencyGraph` relies on,
 * so any downstream analysis would silently return wrong answers. Throwing
 * is strictly preferable to returning unsound results.
 *
 * @param region The region to validate (typically a SeqStmts).
 * @param program The program — used to resolve Call::op_ to a Function and
 *                look up param_directions_.
 * @throws pypto::VerificationError if any violation is found; the error
 *         carries the full set of diagnostics with precise source locations.
