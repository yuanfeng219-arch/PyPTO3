/**
 * @brief Utility class for analyzing parent-child relationships in statement trees
 *
 * This class builds a mapping from each statement to its parent statement within
 * a function's body. It is useful for passes that need to traverse upward in the
 * IR tree or understand the context of a statement.
 *
 * Example usage:
 * @code
 *   ParentStmtAnalysis analysis;
 *   analysis.BuildMap(function);
 *
 *   StmtPtr parent = analysis.GetParent(some_stmt);
 *   if (parent) {
 *     // Use parent statement
 *   }
 * @endcode
 *
 * Key features:
 * - One-time analysis: Build the map once, query multiple times
 * - Root statements have no parent (GetParent returns nullptr)
 * - Handles all statement types: SeqStmts, IfStmt, ForStmt, etc.
 * - Thread-safe for read operations after BuildMap completes
 *
 * Note: The analysis becomes invalid after IR transformations. Call BuildMap again
 * if the IR tree is modified.
